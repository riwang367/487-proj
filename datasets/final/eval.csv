0,harrypotter,when i was an ra  my favorite bulletin board i ever did was a  how our university is like _   board it featured things like the dining hall  great hall   library  sports and intramurals  _   the health center  hospital wing   the university s ghost stories  and so on it was so much fun to make 
1,harrypotter,that s so excellent  i would be so pleased to find this on my first day great job 
2,harrypotter,this was my bulletin board for the month too  p   <URL>
3,harrypotter,you are the type of ra i hope i can be if i manage to get selected  my current ras are great guys  but they did a great gatsby theme instead of _ _ 
4,harrypotter,i love it   
5,harrypotter,this is so cute  i wish my ta was into _ _ our theme was not nearly as cool you should add _ s spew hats and socks for the unsuspecting elves to the _ area  
6,harrypotter,that s really awesome       youtubenl6cdfn2i3i  i would have loved that as my hall in college 
7,harrypotter,1  i totally forget how _ reacts after he sees the memories i think maybe he just sits down and cries for a bit  it was a lot to take in  2  _ kicks _ out of the dungeons after that lesson iirc  _ basically runs out of the dungeons and ends up on some stairs feeling nauseous about how he just saw his father behave  25  _ and _ had started to bully _ on the _ express before they had even gotten sorted yet both _ and _ came from money and gave _ crap for wanting to be in _ house  like his mother _ was   so  _ did not instigate the bullying by fifth year  _ was very much into the _ _ and was hanging around shady people and _ was about to stop being such an arse all the time from _ s point of view  _ stole her from _ s point of view  _ had <URL> toxic and _ was a changed man calling her a _ was the last straw and she cut _ out of her life and _ and her clicked and they started dating  _ s memory did nt change what _ didwas _ grew up and matured  3  in _ _ _ _   at 12 _ during the christmas holidays i think   _ gives _ a package and tells him if he ever should need to be in contact  to use what s in the package _ has just seen a spat between _ and _ and does not want to be the reason _ ends up getting killed so  _ never opens the package  which contained the mirror shard he  does  open the package  after  _ has died and feels like an idiot for not having opened it sooner _ _ ends up stealing stuff from _ place after _ dies he ends up selling the other half of the mirror to _  _ s brother who owns the hog s head tavern   so  when _ keeps seeing bright blue eyes in the mirror during _ _  it s actually _ keeping a watchful eye on _ in case he needs help  4  _ had just asked _ if he had grown to care about _ _ casts his _ it s a doe just like _ s _ was a doe _ realizes that _ is still fighting for _  _ after all this time   _ replies  always   in that _ had always loved _ in that he never stopped  or will stop  loving her 
8,harrypotter,all of these questions are answered by the books  and some answered might be a little spoilery for some aspects that the movies never went into if you d rather not have any further spoilers  please stop reading here  a this is complicated and is actually a long overarcing thread in the last book through out the book  _  at many points  feels very frustrated with _ and the amount of secrets he kept from _ however he also comes to see that mostly when _ was keeping secrets  it was as a benefit to _ it might not be something _ liked  but it was something he needed eventually  _ makes a decision to trust in _ s judgement and sort of comes to accept that he can not always know everything and that sometimes he needs to not act  which is enormously hard for him   when he sees those memories  he does think about _ s betrayal  but it feels to him as a minor thing against the knowledge that he has to die  gt  slowly  very slowly  he sat up  and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was  brain and nerve and bounding heart  it would all be gone    or at least  he would be gone from it his breath came slow and deep  and his mouth and throat were completely dry  but so were his eyes  gt  _  s betrayal was almost nothing of course there had been a bigger plan  _ had simply been too foolish to see it  he realized that now  the thing is that _ does see the sense of it he understands why _ did what he did  and he understands why he is the one who has to die  and if it is him  then nobody else has to at this point  _ s emotions are a huge mess he is in a great state of shock and wanting to live but knowing he can not  so anger is not at the forefront of his brain eventually when he meets _  after being killed  by _  the shock has worn off  but he is still mostly confused  which keeps him from feeling anger it also helps that pretty much one of the first things _ tells him is that he is not exactly dead then _ goes on to explain and apologises to _  with tears in his eyes  which helps _ understand that everything _ did  he did nt do for the funsies he made these decisions because they were the best ones  but they were nt easy or kind  not even on _ himself  which is what helps _ come to peace with them  honestly  the books go way more in depth with _ s feelings re  _ than anyone could ever do in a simple post  so i very much urge you to read them it will help clarify a lot  b when _ first finds out about the bully _ was in the past  it actually bothers him a lot there is quite a chunk of the fifth book that deals with _ thinking about what he saw in the pensive and his father s behaviour he does quite a dangerous thing  using _ s fire to talk to _ and _  just to get more information on his father s behaviour eventually he learns to give it a place he still loves his father  obviously  but he thinks of him with slightly less blind idealism still  from all accounts  it does seem like _  honestly  changed  and _ was nt exactly innocent in all of it either  _ and _ pretty much continuously hexed each other  so it is not like _ is an unrepenting douchebag either he s a person who made douchy choices as a teen  but also made a lot of good ones during that same time of his life  who eventually grew out of it  which is sort of how _ comes to remember him  c in the _ _ _ _  after christmas  _ gives _ one of a pair of twoway mirrors but does nt explain them they are basically like mirror walkietalkies  that _ and _ used to use to talk to each other in detention _  realising it is a way to contact _  fears that doing so will make _ do something stupid and dangerous and puts them in the bottom of his trunk he forgets about them  even when he needs them most after _ s death  _ remembers the mirror  however because _ is dead  he can not use them anymore still  he does nt get rid of it it eventually shatters  but _ keeps the biggest piece the second mirror  the one that belonged to _ is found by _ when he is looting _ s house for stuff to sell he sells that mirror to _  _ s brother  who realises what is _ uses the mirror to keep an eye on _  it is his blue eye _ sees  and eventually uses it to send _ to them when they are in great danger  d _ loved _ _ has never loved anyone but _ _ cared great for him  as a friend  and potentially more according to _  but the path _ put himself on  the one with the _ _  turned her away from him it all came to a head when _ called her a _ _ ended their friendship there  but _ did nt stop loving her because he loved her  he tried to ask _ to spare her  and through that  gave _ an out  which she refused to take but instead protected her son   knowing that _ loved _ so much  _ used that love to get _ on their side when _ asks if _ s feeling are still the same after all this time  _ casts that _  _ s _ had been a doe as well  and tell him  yes  always he s still in this for _ 
9,harrypotter,this is the problem with watching the movies first     read the books asap the movies are fun entertainment but you wo nt get nearly as much out of them as you will out of the books i hope you get to soon and you re enjoying your hp journey  i can try to answer some of your questions  in the books _ goes through some more emotions about _ having known he would need to die ultimately i think he comes out still admiring _ because he knew how hard it was for him and that this was the only choice also  he was going through so many emotions about his own life that being mad at someone else was nt at the top of his mind  i think the __ thing is very much up for debate i ve heard a lot of insightful things on this sub though  the mirror was from _ he gave it to him as a gift there are two that are connected  the idea being _ had one and _ had one and they would be able to talk through them   someone correct me if i m wrong but i think _ gets the other one after it was stolen from _ place by _  _ is represented by a doe this makes sense because she and _ were together and his _  and probably _  was a stag the _ is important because it is much stronger evidence that he still loves _ than just saying he does they talk about how only something really powerful emotionally can change a person s _  hope this helps other people help me out if i ve missed stuff i m sure i ve messed up a lot of spelling  sorry about that 
10,harrypotter,hi  i got some questions i want to ask about the films i ve never read the books  but i plan to   and i guessed this would be the best place to ask them i m also on mobile so please tell me if the formatting is dodgy  first one is why was nt _ angry at _ after _ died   he saw _ s memory of _ manipulating _ into  raising him as pig to slaughter  yet when he saw him he did nt seem too bothered  in fact he looked like he still admired him  another question is what do you think _ thinks of his father after seeing _ s memory of him  cause to me it looked like he was a bully and stole _ from him was there something that _ did that gave _ the right to do that to him  or was it _ s hate for _ that literally changed his memory  where did _ get the mirror shard and where did the mirror even come from  i ve looked through the films and there s no mention of it but then in the _ _ _ suddenly has it with no explanation  one more  what is the significance of _ s _  i know he loved _  but when _ just randomly mentions _ when he casts the doe  it s not really clear what he means  does he just ask if he loved her  would make sense after _ s  always   thanks guys i do love this subreddit  _ _ is pretty much my favourite film series as i grew up as the same age as _ and the lot  definitely an experience that i loved but did nt know was happening at the time 
11,harrypotter,unless _ employed professor wade wilson  probably not 
12,harrypotter,someone s got  neverending story  in their brain   
13,harrypotter,_ privy to the _ _ via a book series  the ministry would be all over that 
14,harrypotter,you ve had too much dragon dust 
15,harrypotter,do you think that these characters knew the readers could  see  what they were doing and sometimes even read their thoughts  the very thought of this has blown my mind   
16,harrypotter,would nt it be crazy if he and _ ended up in the same house  i think it would be _  to be honest 
17,harrypotter,probably _
18,harrypotter,i think based on the type of person he looked up to  his mother and father  he would most likely be _
19,harrypotter,a _  maybe  i m not sure  he s not really brave  he s does nt care about knowledge  he s not a hard worker and he s not cunning  but he may be a _ because he wants to be praised and desires glory 
20,harrypotter,he s pretty much a _ _ or _  so _ 
21,harrypotter,_ he s pretty straightforward with everything  and it  was  brave of him to defend _ in front of his parents 
22,harrypotter,international house of pancakes  seriously  though  it s kind of like asking which house of congress kanye west would be better suited for  at any rate  jk has already pointed out that while she briefly considered _ ending up with a magical child  she ultimately decided that magical blood had no chance of <URL> dursley dna 
23,harrypotter,_ _ s real crybaby behavior comes out around _ i think we see the true _ with the _ when he thinks _ is performing magic and threats wo nt stop him  he slugs _ then  he gets away wrong direction  but it s the proactive behavior that counts  i agree _ s a possibility too he was nt a hard worker at 11  but i think that changes when the diet starts he starts so overweight and unhealthy that he feels tired going from the kitchen to the living room a year later  he s a boxing _ who is more muscle than fat that takes hard work 
24,harrypotter,rewatching all the movies  since i just finished the books for the first time   and while watching the sorceressphilosophers stone earlier today i started thinking about the _ house question when _ mistook him for _ i think he could be _ or maybe even _ 
25,harrypotter,hilarious 
26,harrypotter,genius jvl 
27,harrypotter,lol 
28,harrypotter,breaking news  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said the senate should not confirm a replacement for supreme court justice antonin scalia until after all of the late justice  s _ have been destroyed   a _ is a powerful artifact in which a _ has hidden a piece of his or her soul in hopes of attaining immortality   stated mcconnell  justice scalia  s body may be dead but  by creating _  _ _ scalia gained the ability to anchor his soul to the earth   it  s not a surprise   said a senior white house official  we  ve known for some time that scalia was inching closer and closer to true immortality as his body withered away  republicans in congress and in the 2016 presidential field united behind mcconnell  contending that the circumstances of scalia  s death  the first _ chase since frank murphy famously thrust a dragon  s tooth through the diary of pierce butler before being confirmed  made it necessary to leave the appointment until every piece of scalia  s tangible soul had been vanquished  senate minority leader _ reid lined up firmly behind president obama  the president can and should send the senate a nominee right away   he said in a statement  it would be unprecedented in recent history for a supreme court seat to remain vacant while a team of courageous _ hunt down the vestiges of scalia  s dark power  calls to honor the tradition of highcourt nominations in spite of the dark _  s shadowy tokens were immediately rejected by senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley  riowa   who stated plainly that he has no plans to start up the confirmation process on his panel until the last relics had been quelled   this president  above all others  has made no bones about his goal to use the courts to circumvent the will of dark _ and push through his own agenda   grassley said  it only makes sense that we wait until the ghostly monuments of his darkness have been dismantled before moving forward  by using his power as chairman to block a vote in committee  grassley can prevent democrats from trying to call up a nomination on the senate floor  at least until every antique carrying the spirit of scalia has been lay waste to  sens rubio of florida and cruz of texas urged mcconnell to block a new confirmation rubio said the nomination could absolutely not occur while the _ remained by threat of armageddon  while cruz bluntly said it is the senate  s duty to slow down a confirmation process until the cold heirlooms of the late justice had been found and eradicated   justice scalia was a dark _ we owe it to him  amp  the nation  for the senate to ensure that there is no replacement while the power of scalia  s _ remains   cruz said on twitter  wrote this while bored of working hope you enjoyed it  jacob van lunen
29,harrypotter,as an employee there  i ca nt wait to get my first shift on a tech rehearsal day i ve done all my training and i m so excited help all you _ and _ learn how to greet a _  the creative team worked so hard to bring this to life the detail is absolutely stunning i ve been on forbidden journey three times now and it is one of the best rides i ve ever been on i d <URL> following  micechat on twitter for updates on when tech rehearsals are happening 
30,harrypotter,i have a facebook friend who works there as a member of the singing frog choir  and she seemed to start training this week she just posted a picture of the whole choir in costume in the park  so they must be getting ready to start that portion soon 
31,harrypotter,in a matter of speaking they are doing a technical run  and almost everything is open up for use by the general public you can go on the rides  get _  and drink some _ however  i was told that this was subject to change and that they will be open or closed in a random sort of way  but if you have a pass i d say give it a shot and try to see if it s open 
32,starwars,i would hope they d rework some of the controls as well  combat worked fine but movement is painful 
33,starwars,there are pipe dreams and then there s a drug induced coma 
34,starwars, it s not going to last very long     <URL> 
35,starwars,apparently that is  rogwa     <URL>  
36,starwars, rogwa wodrata     <URL>   who is infact female
37,starwars,i ca nt seem to find out his identity does anyone know who this is and what species he is  i took two screenshots  he is on the far left in both     <URL>
38,starwars,i was seeing it the first day it came out so i had a social media blackout between the midnight screenings and the evening when i saw it in a moment of forgetfulness i checked twitter and saw  chewiedies  i thought i had ruined the film for myself  but convinced myself that it was just as easily someone trolling as it could be true the person could ve put that without seeing the movie and still be correct  so i thought nothing of it when i started watching the movie the _ _ death was so obviously going to happen from the moment _ was confirmed to be his son that i was actually hoping that it was a setup and the film was leading you to believe _ would die and do a  _ dies saving him  twist alas this did not happen and i was very disappointed with how predictable the film was so knowing ahead of time that _ dies would nt have ruined it for me because i worked it out from the minute the parentage was confirmed 
39,starwars,people guessing and just happen to be right postmovie 
40,starwars,my job puts me in contact with more than a few superfans the unquenchable thirst to be the one that  knows  what happened combined with troll culture creates people who love to ruin the big twist no matter if it was unforeseen or obvious as day it s pretty hard to ignore the internet these days 
41,starwars,that movie s plot point was so obvious i knew it before the teaser trailer was even released it s so hard to talk about it without spoilers but it had to happen  because the actor really wanted it to hell he wanted it in _ edit  the new trilogy is also a multi year project and the actor in question may not have that much left in him in the process of filming the new movie he was in both a plane crash and a broken ankle 
42,starwars,early showings  script leaks  people on the set  deduction from other leaks so we know that this character is in the movie  but they have no more scenes following this one scene that they were ultrasecretive about yup  we know what happened 
43,starwars,my cousins have a similar story  they were watching a friend s magic showhe spoiled that particular scene  i was lucky to avoid everything sw for three months  outside the teaser trailer  
44,starwars,i had a copy of the script three days before release things get leaked  stills  premiers  advanced screenings  etc 
45,starwars,advanced screenings  production leaks  screener copies getting into the wrong hands  etc  most people are pretty civil  but all it takes is one asshole to ruin it for everyone 
46,starwars,it was released in europe 2 days before it was released in the united states it was available as a lowquality torrent within hours 
47,starwars,before the movie even was released i had the movie s biggest death scene spoiled for me by my fucktard brother  and he had read it somewhere online  facebook   my question is  how are things like this spoiled before the movie is even released 
48,starwars,excluding _  _  and _ 
49,starwars,no uncle _ 
50,starwars,is it just me or does _ look a lot more like patame in that picture 
51,starwars,love this  great style little ben is adorable 
52,starwars,not from _ but my brother and i were watching _ _ _ and decided to take a drink every time _ opened his mouth then we decided every other sentence then we chose to live and did every scene where he has a speaking part
53,starwars,drink any time a _ is fired at a _ and the shot misses 
54,starwars,oo  another one take a drink whenever someone gets _ through the chest 
55,starwars,rule 2  take a shot for every 100 anonymous _ deaths  that ll empty a bottle in about 5 episodes 
56,starwars,take a sip any time a _ is destroyed 
57,starwars,take a drink any time a _ dies and everybody acts all sad  but nobody cares when a _ dies 
58,starwars,take a shot any time _ gets electrocuted 
59,starwars,every time  _ spoilers   s  fives dies   drink until your liver commits suicide 
60,starwars,i value my liver dude
61,starwars,any time someone fallscrashes and would normally be dead in real life  take a shot 
62,starwars,or _ are like 99  of all carnivores on earth  especially the more braindeveloped ones  and do nt eat anything they do nt kill themselves given that they attempted to cook _ and _ before killing them  i doubt they d collect and cook alreadydead stormtroopers
63,starwars,they sure did    youtubeqds6re3hgo
64,leagueoflegends,_ will always be a good option between _ or _ though  i d say _ _ is also a great option 
65,leagueoflegends,_ is decent 
66,leagueoflegends,get _ nobody expects _ top then you just rub your gems all over their face 
67,leagueoflegends,_ fuck 6300 shit
68,leagueoflegends,get dr boom it s the best   card   _ in the game right now and he works with any   deck   team comp plus   _ _ will never nerf him

71,leagueoflegends,i got 63k ip which _ do you guys suggest  was leaning to __ 
72,leagueoflegends,great survey  best of luck on the project 
73,leagueoflegends,great survey  you should do an aftermath post 
74,leagueoflegends,hello people from reddit  i m a _ from _ _ _ and i m asking for your help to do this survey  its a personalschool project  i would like to see is there positivenegative impact while playing _ _ _   <URL> lt  here s the link if you are interested
75,leagueoflegends,i get really upset every time these casters pronounce  _  as  zeezyrot 
76,leagueoflegends,just put wickd on the bench  he does nothing for the team and gets more resources than any other player in game cw denied all the resources possible to werlyb and let wickd on a sidelane pushing 1v1 against holyphoenix and he goes aggresive  dies 1v1 wasting both _ and wasnt even half as usefull as werlyb was on _ 
77,leagueoflegends,haha wickd gt  lt 
78,leagueoflegends,i could nt see it  how was sirnukesalot playing  i always hope for him to do well but cw seem to lose all of their games  
79,leagueoflegends,actually it was pretty sad to see cw trying to deny resources from werlyb to put wickd ahead and see how he still does shit  the 2nd game was just a very wp game by huma  i would love to see welyb  godbro and _ in lcs but that will be hard  millenium is pretty good even if they lost today and inspire are so good too 
80,leagueoflegends,btw boys  dat godbro is the same guy as neegodbro the former top laner from cw 
81,leagueoflegends,sirnukes is a classic example of his trope
82,leagueoflegends,time to start banning _ again 
83,leagueoflegends,godbro _ is nasty man 
84,leagueoflegends,_ played really well this series
85,leagueoflegends,_ on _ feelstsmman
86,leagueoflegends,retire already wickd 
87,leagueoflegends,maybe thats just me but i find it super weird how much huma prioritizes _ on _
88,leagueoflegends,werlyb is actually a pretty good player i always felt like he was underrated on giants i m glad he s doing alright in challenger series and i hope to see this team in lcs  probably wo nt be possible with inspire amp  millenium playing like they are right now tho

154,gameofthrones,they ve all killed each other without acknowledging the  real  enemy amassing north of the wall that s why it s called a  game  of thrones 
155,gameofthrones,i could and would argue that the seven great houses are still in tact meaning they could be a stronger bond than the realm itself living through this rebellion and that  including ww   not saying this is the end game  as i m sure some will actually see its  line end but just a thought  for the moment at least 
156,gameofthrones,i think _ said it best about the  wheel  of all the big 7 houses playing their  _   she wants to  break the wheel  
157,gameofthrones,_ does own lands  _  i think
158,gameofthrones,_ could still be alive 
159,gameofthrones,i have a theory that there are too many theoretical theories going around  how s that for a theory 
160,himym,next time i watch _ all the way through  i m skipping the last 10 minutes of the finale and watching this
161,himym,i have nt and will never watch the finale this show ends on the wedding day for me 
162,himym,main issue from my point of view  is that show s title and season 9  which should nt have happened  but extended due to shows  popularity  raised audiences expectations about the mother we sympathized for the mother due to her frequent appearances in s9  if i accept this alternate ending as the true ending  then i would feel just terrible for _ from the beginning  creators wanted _ to end up with _ i spent <SMILE> years watching her getting along with the group instead  she ended up alone  regretting her decisions  cast aside  and prob live alone forever 
163,himym,this ending is so much better the original ending was just a slap in the face <SMILE> years of building up a character for nothing we already moved pass _ and _ they are nt for each other why force it  then the kids getting all perky and hyper right after their dad was talking about their dead mother  does nt fit the show at all title is  how i met your mother  not aunt whoever decided to use the original ending failed at their job makes me happy  how i met your dad  is nt going to happen hell they even screwed up the title on that one 
164,himym,why could nt we just have this    
165,himym,this still does nt make me happy i feel sad when i think about how _ is barley part of the group anymore  i need this fixed and then i will be okay 
166,himym,i like this  but it makes a lot of scenes from the show meaningless  and also cuts out a lot of great scenes the ending we got was the ending we were always supposed to get  and i think it fits the show perfectly sure it could have been executed better  like giving _ and _ s marriage more time on the show  but otherwise i think it worked out great 
167,himym,way better than the blue french horn ending i m all for the yellow umbrella
168,himym,i prefer the emotional roller coaster of the original ending this is too fairly tale 
169,himym,this used to be my favorite show it was my background noise whenever i did nt have anything to watch  or do  i would put how i met your mother on and just let it play i loved the show  i loved the characters  i loved everything about it i can not count how many times i ve watched it through until the finale i m not arguing a side of how it should have ended it just left a bitter taste in my mouth i ve never had something like that happen before i have nt been able to bring myself to watch it since it ended because i just could nt believe how it all ended up and again  i m not arguing one way or the other  but the originally ending tarnished such a great feeling in my memory and it may be stupid to some  but some of you may understand on a personal level this ending just feels right  and i do nt think i would be bitter about it i do nt care that he ended up with _ i just feel cheated to have been given such an amazing perfect character to only have it all taken away in such a quick impersonal way and i guess that may be the point life cheats you  life does nt care how you ve invested yourself it goes on whether you like it or not but seeing this  for the first time btw  gave me those feelings i used to have for the show again maybe i can start over again and like it the way i used to wow i ve been ranting sorry about that 
170,himym,perfect 
171,himym,my ideal season 9 would ve been the finale  just stretched over 24 episodes  i think it should have been flashbacks to the wedding over the 17 years that the finale covered then the divorce would ve been a good mid season finale  and we would have been able to enjoy some of the better moments of the finale and probably had better closure with tm s death 
172,himym,but the real question is  is it white and gold or blue and black 
173,himym,so what does it say about your brain if you see a duck first vs seeing a rabbit first 
174,himym,i m sorry to be that guy but this image is extremely well known  at least around where i m from   i had seen it at least five or six times in various elementarymiddle schoolhigh school classes before i watched _
175,himym,not sure if you re serious  these have been the exact names of maltomeal s brand knockoffs for decades 
176,himym,here is what the linked meme says in case it is blocked at your schoolwork or is unavailable for any reason      _ finale fail roll    gt     post title      how the _ writers came up with that finale  gt     top      _ s met the mother what do you do now   gt     bottom      end the show with the happy ending everyone wants    original link  1     <URL>    meme template  2     <URL> 
177,himym,towards the end of the race i noticed  when _  _ and _ meet up right before they get to gregors from the way the three of them met up again  wouldnt _ have been there basically the same time it took them to meet on the corner before the last stretch when _ tackled _  so why did she just run to gregors and win much sooner  obviously this is digging pretty far into the  why  factor but i just became very curious

179,himym,i ca nt see  the ballad of sir frankie crisp  by george harrisons
180,himym,got ta add heaven by the walkmen on there
181,himym,i have that song on my list but i do nt remember where i pulled it from 
182,himym,simple song is on there it s one of my favorites off the list
183,himym,does nt even have the theme in it   <URL>  v  zqypufdndb0
184,himym,you could add  here i dreamt i was an architect  by the decemberists and  forest whitaker  by bad books
185,himym,i could nt find nothing suits you like a suit either to clarify i did nt make the playlist just found it and thought i d share
186,himym,no  simple song  
187,himym,la vie en rose mom plays on ukelele
188,himym,no murder train 
189,himym,this entire playlist should have been  im gon na be  on an infinite loop as a gag
190,himym,you could add the funeral  by band of horses  i think it s in s<SMILE>e1 
191,himym,i agree with you op i just started watching _ last week and i ca nt stand _  _ and sometimes _  _ is just a massive pseudointellectual douche he s so mean to people  ca nt make mature decisions and when he likes a girl he just falls crazy in love and ca nt take no for an answer  it s not realistic at all especially when he does some bad things to his partners  especially _  yet it s okay because he was reacting to something they did which is complete bs  _ also pisses me off because she thinks she s always right and dishing out justice for the group based on some sick moral compass she does some pretty horrible things to _ too  like the episode where she calls him to ditch his date  to change her tyre in the middle of nowhere and then leave him then not call and expect everything to go back to normal and she bloody hits _ a lot  ftm violence is just as bad  i do nt care if people find it funnynot that i can see how she also ca nt keep secrets  ruins relationships and is a terrible person  just like _ is to some girls  _ and _ are okay but not as bad now _ definitely does douchey things constantly  but i feel for him because he s the odd one out in the group always getting picked on  and i think we can only pity him because we know his sense of confidence is exaggerated and artificial based on some deeper issues in his past that he has nt dealt with and his fragile emotions  so that s why _  _  evil and _  awesome

220,mylittlepony,rinachan  kira  used to be such a  huge  fan va if you look at older animations and such  she was everywhere but nowacking and possibly others seem to have really surpassed her these days 
221,mylittlepony, i should probrably not get sucked into this but i ll just go for it anyway and see what happens no regrets yet  it s really a shame when people throw out all of there work  and leave no evidence or context of what happened  i know she is hurt  but i know idea why we can sit hear and get all emotional about it  or move on because she s cut down her lines of communication down to one last video and what is now possibly a dead channel  all in all there is nothing to see here or do  for all who think i m being a jerk ok sure  i d say she is already long gone and will never come back  she already cause this much selfdestruction  her best option is really not to come back and just have fun doing something else  she sounds young and not mature enough to handle the demands of her audience 13ksubs like that can be alot of pressure the demands she could have made for herself and the regular online nasty that comes with ever increasing exposure  what she really needs is a good talking to which does nt seem possible anymore unless she steps forward  begging her to come back wo nt make things better it makes things complicated and it s not good for what seems to me a formative experience  and op u_sheik1 gt  who would do such a thing to her  really  tier 1 shit concerns  it actually does nt matter anymore  nor should we care who or what kind of person did whatever they did  what matter is how to help  secondly it sounds like from what she said  i ve done some things i ve said some things  that she is taking some fault and responsiblity of something or anything and with  they ve been circling around  it also seems like her trust has been betrayed  chances are she connected her youtube channel and twitter account too close to her personal life and has reaped the consequences of having such a set up for convenience  something that kids would do without thinking too much into it  actually with all this said i realize that i m wasting my time  gg game over she is nt coming back  why should we care like really   nobody can help other than spam her with consolation to her now dead channel     discordgrump     walkingabout  i m out

226,startrek,_ is a great place to start it s a nice introduction to the universe of _ then go to _  then ds9 then _ 
227,startrek,it depends on whether you like scifi or action if you re an action movie fan and do nt care about writing  then the new stuff 
228,startrek,_ is what my dad started me on as a kid i d <URL> starting the even though i grew up on it  i ll openly admit that it can get kinda cheesy here and there 
229,startrek,i d start with next gen  personally as i kid i got into the original series by watching the movies  then went back and watched the show 
230,startrek,you are a new fan because you saw what  i started with _ 2009  then went to season 1 episode 1 tng but as a general rule  _ is a tv series  the movies are more like an appendage  p i still <URL> having a go at st 2009 before going into the series tho  because is fun  but what you will get in the series is so much better 
231,startrek,probably _  _ _ _  _ might be a bit hard to watch as it shows its age in places  that s not saying people should nt watch it   i do nt think you d get a complete idea of what _ is supposed to be about from the other series 
232,startrek,if you must do movies  i d do out of order  _ iv  _ _ _ first  just to get them interested  you know it s a pretty standard adventure and you do nt really need all the backstory  yet   once you got them interested  do a marathon st2st3st4 i personally is extremely  meh  on st5 
233,startrek,all these other comments are good  but to answer your question i highly <URL> _ it s widely considered the best _ film  and it s easy to get into since it was written as a movie for general audiences  thus you do nt really need to watch space seed before watching the movie   it was my first introduction to _ and it worked for me 
234,startrek,the movies are based on characters and stories that were built up from the tv series i would actually <URL> trying _ _ _ tv series  and go through the guides others have posted do nt be afraid to skip bad episodes in the first couple seasons i wrote a personalized opinion  here     <URL>  context  3  a few weeks ago about which episodes were most important to watch in the first couple seasons i stand behind my assessment  if you really want to go with a film  just watch the first of the 2009 series do nt watch into darkness until much later  because it kind of ruins things that happened in one of the actual best films in the franchise if you enjoy the 2009 film  go back to the original series  watch the episode space seed  and any of the other good ones  there are lists all over the web of the best of _   then start with _ 2  the _  and just finish that series off 5 is skippable  it s a pretty bad film altogether the motion picture is also skippable  it s not a great film either and it s really dense unless you re deep into the _ universe it s worth watching at some point  but it really is  bad 2001  a space odyssey 
235,startrek,i have to agree with the others  the heart and soul of _ is the various tv series  the movies are just a bonus the movies are mostly action focused and tend to revolve around evil villains who are up to no good and must be stopped  which is a poor reflection of what the franchise has to offer as a whole  the original series from the 60s is the true starting point  but it can be difficult for a modern viewer to get into _ _ _ is the gentlest entry point as it s not quite as dated  but be aware that its first two seasons are a bit sucky deep space nine is my personal favourite  and is generally well regarded by fans  but it s best watched after having seen tng _ and _ have some good qualities  but probably are nt the best place to start 
236,startrek,although i agree with the answers you ve received  _ is really about the tv shows  and _ is probably the best place to start  just be warned that the first 2 seasons of _ are nt exactly great tv   i think it s worth actually answering the question in the title of your post  if you really want to start with the movies  watch the original series movies  ivi   i and v are not universally liked  but the rest are good  and will give you a reasonable idea of what _ is about  sadly  the _ movies are not very good  the reboot movies are good action movies but do nt really represent _ 
237,startrek,  <URL> but do nt start with movies in general the heart of _ is tv start with them 
238,startrek,_ is a tv franchise with film spinoffs your best option would be starting with _ or _    <URL> i started watching _ last october with _  and i d <URL> starting from there if you can get past the 60s feel and slowpaced storytelling  it s the show that started it all then you can continue on with the films and shows in  the correct order  you see in the guide above  if it s too dated for you  start with _ the first two seasons are rough  but season 3 and on is great every _ series after _ takes about two seasons to find its footing  so give them a chance before giving up  here s a more detailed guide i d <URL> also giving a read basically expands on what i just said    <URL>
239,startrek,hey everyone  i m completely foreign to the _ i was wondering what series i should start with the old movies   ivi  _ _ _   19942002  the reboot series   2009present  or what tv series 
240,startrek,see  i was interested  but then i saw it was not the enterprisee 
241,startrek,why ncc1701   a    i could understand the original or d  but why a 
242,startrek,can we just start calling drones what they really are  toys they re rc toys 
243,startrek,so the quad is in the saucer section  i assumed the stardrive section has the electronics and battery that means the entire thing is horribly unbalanced  and probably terrible to fly 
244,startrek,is there any video of this in action 
245,startrek,so even _ _ can fly it 
246,startrek,mmmmm and it s a _ refit never more happy that i clicked a link 
247,startrek,i got this  data took the test when everyone else was on summer holidays  since  as an an_  he does nt really take vacation so he thought he d do something more concrete and useful  d
248,startrek,fun backstage anecdote  _ was given a standard uniform by the costume department  and only then did the writers start writing her into stories where she got to drive the plot by being competent  dress for the job you want 
249,startrek,it might be that the bridge officers test is something specific for officers and personnel that are not on a command  operations  or science track since _ and _ are the only two we have canonical evidence of having taken the test  it might be one of many additional certifications an already commis_ed officer can study and attain  analogous to how cadets at _ medical academy can take engineering exten_ courses  and likewise  _ and _ s rank and promotions  as officers separate from the standard officer track  their promotion to commander should probably be considered differently as a medical rank and is not really analogous to a commander in command  operations  or sciences 
250,startrek,you have it wrong the real question is  did the command test come with a  crash  course for starship piloting 
251,startrek,you have to remember that in any entertaining story they have to skip the uninteresting parts it s possible that data did have a similar experience but it was nt particularly challenging for him so they did nt bother to tell that story instead the show focuses more on data s struggle with basic human interactions 
252,startrek,i think it s because _ is a counselor  and had no command training in her background 
253,startrek,bit off topic  but reading some of the comments  it makes me wonder how on _  from the start in the alpha quadrant  their head of operations was an _  surely there were more qualified people than _ out of the whole of _ to be the new operations manager 
254,startrek,i think it s got to do with how the line of command works  _ and doctor _ were both medicalline officers  and so they did nt automatically have authority over people outside of their departments except in medical and psychological matters  there was probably some _ regulations which made it that medical officers could nt be put in command unless they demonstrated to the captain or the xo that they were capable of it  i do nt think this was as big a deal for officers in the engineering  operations or security departments over the course of their careers  they were more likely to be put in charge of away teams or small teams to do things onboard so  over the course of the years  they d gain experience commanding small numbers of people and would eventually be allowed to command larger numbers of people  even _ was put in charge of a science group for that one episode  i m thinking it was called pen pals  i might be wrong   this was because he was being trained for a commandline position in the long run chances are that  had he chosen to stay in _  he would nt have had to take the same kind of command test that _ had  or if he did  it would have only been a formality  this was nt really the case for people in the medical department they were stuck doing medical work in sickbay for the most part because that was their job  i think the command test was probably designed mostly for people from the medical line who decided they wanted command of a ship eventually the promotion to full commander was probably just an honourary thing  and did nt automatically put them in the ship s line of command unless the captain decided that would be the case  the real test for people who wanted to gain their own command would be the _ _ test  or something similar to it even for someone who d been in the command line their entire career  it s hard to know how they re going to respond to that kind of situation unless they re tested for it  so they give them the simulation  the test _ took would probably have been considered a _ _ for people in the medical line 
255,startrek,probably based on their fields  operations officer would be assumed to need some basic bridge command lessons but not so much with the ships counselor
