0,harrypotter,when i was an ra  my favorite bulletin board i ever did was a  how our university is like hogwarts   board it featured things like the dining hall  great hall   library  sports and intramurals  quidditch   the health center  hospital wing   the university s ghost stories  and so on it was so much fun to make 
1,harrypotter,that s so excellent  i would be so pleased to find this on my first day great job 
2,harrypotter,this was my bulletin board for the month too  p   <URL>
3,harrypotter,you are the type of ra i hope i can be if i manage to get selected  my current ras are great guys  but they did a great gatsby theme instead of harry potter 
4,harrypotter,i love it   
5,harrypotter,this is so cute  i wish my ta was into harry potter our theme was not nearly as cool you should add hermione s spew hats and socks for the unsuspecting elves to the gryffindor area  
6,harrypotter,that s really awesome       youtubenl6cdfn2i3i  i would have loved that as my hall in college 
7,harrypotter,1  i totally forget how harry reacts after he sees the memories i think maybe he just sits down and cries for a bit  it was a lot to take in  2  snape kicks harry out of the dungeons after that lesson iirc  harry basically runs out of the dungeons and ends up on some stairs feeling nauseous about how he just saw his father behave  25  sirius and james had started to bully snape on the hogwarts express before they had even gotten sorted yet both james and sirius came from money and gave snape crap for wanting to be in slytherin house  like his mother eileen was   so  snape did not instigate the bullying by fifth year  snape was very much into the dark arts and was hanging around shady people and james was about to stop being such an arse all the time from snape s point of view  james stole her from lily s point of view  snape had <URL> toxic and james was a changed man calling her a mudblood was the last straw and she cut snape out of her life and james and her clicked and they started dating  snape s memory did nt change what james didwas james grew up and matured  3  in order of the phoenix   at 12 grimmauld during the christmas holidays i think   sirius gives harry a package and tells him if he ever should need to be in contact  to use what s in the package harry has just seen a spat between snape and sirius and does not want to be the reason sirius ends up getting killed so  harry never opens the package  which contained the mirror shard he  does  open the package  after  sirius has died and feels like an idiot for not having opened it sooner mundungus feltcher ends up stealing stuff from grimmauld place after sirius dies he ends up selling the other half of the mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother who owns the hog s head tavern   so  when harry keeps seeing bright blue eyes in the mirror during deathly hallows  it s actually aberforth keeping a watchful eye on harry in case he needs help  4  dumbledore had just asked snape if he had grown to care about harry snape casts his patronus it s a doe just like lily s patronus was a doe dumbledore realizes that snape is still fighting for lily  lily after all this time   snape replies  always   in that snape had always loved lily in that he never stopped  or will stop  loving her 
8,harrypotter,all of these questions are answered by the books  and some answered might be a little spoilery for some aspects that the movies never went into if you d rather not have any further spoilers  please stop reading here  a this is complicated and is actually a long overarcing thread in the last book through out the book  harry  at many points  feels very frustrated with dumbledore and the amount of secrets he kept from harry however he also comes to see that mostly when dumbledore was keeping secrets  it was as a benefit to harry it might not be something harry liked  but it was something he needed eventually  harry makes a decision to trust in dumbledore s judgement and sort of comes to accept that he can not always know everything and that sometimes he needs to not act  which is enormously hard for him   when he sees those memories  he does think about dumbledore s betrayal  but it feels to him as a minor thing against the knowledge that he has to die  gt  slowly  very slowly  he sat up  and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was  brain and nerve and bounding heart  it would all be gone    or at least  he would be gone from it his breath came slow and deep  and his mouth and throat were completely dry  but so were his eyes  gt  dumbledore  s betrayal was almost nothing of course there had been a bigger plan  harry had simply been too foolish to see it  he realized that now  the thing is that harry does see the sense of it he understands why dumbledore did what he did  and he understands why he is the one who has to die  and if it is him  then nobody else has to at this point  harry s emotions are a huge mess he is in a great state of shock and wanting to live but knowing he can not  so anger is not at the forefront of his brain eventually when he meets dumbledore  after being killed  by voldemort  the shock has worn off  but he is still mostly confused  which keeps him from feeling anger it also helps that pretty much one of the first things dumbledore tells him is that he is not exactly dead then dumbledore goes on to explain and apologises to harry  with tears in his eyes  which helps harry understand that everything dumbledore did  he did nt do for the funsies he made these decisions because they were the best ones  but they were nt easy or kind  not even on dumbledore himself  which is what helps harry come to peace with them  honestly  the books go way more in depth with harry s feelings re  dumbledore than anyone could ever do in a simple post  so i very much urge you to read them it will help clarify a lot  b when harry first finds out about the bully james was in the past  it actually bothers him a lot there is quite a chunk of the fifth book that deals with harry thinking about what he saw in the pensive and his father s behaviour he does quite a dangerous thing  using umbridge s fire to talk to sirius and lupin  just to get more information on his father s behaviour eventually he learns to give it a place he still loves his father  obviously  but he thinks of him with slightly less blind idealism still  from all accounts  it does seem like james  honestly  changed  and snape was nt exactly innocent in all of it either  james and snape pretty much continuously hexed each other  so it is not like james is an unrepenting douchebag either he s a person who made douchy choices as a teen  but also made a lot of good ones during that same time of his life  who eventually grew out of it  which is sort of how harry comes to remember him  c in the order of the phoenix  after christmas  sirius gives harry one of a pair of twoway mirrors but does nt explain them they are basically like mirror walkietalkies  that sirius and james used to use to talk to each other in detention harry  realising it is a way to contact sirius  fears that doing so will make sirius do something stupid and dangerous and puts them in the bottom of his trunk he forgets about them  even when he needs them most after sirius s death  harry remembers the mirror  however because sirius is dead  he can not use them anymore still  he does nt get rid of it it eventually shatters  but harry keeps the biggest piece the second mirror  the one that belonged to sirius is found by mundungus when he is looting sirius s house for stuff to sell he sells that mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother  who realises what is aberforth uses the mirror to keep an eye on harry  it is his blue eye harry sees  and eventually uses it to send dobby to them when they are in great danger  d snape loved lily snape has never loved anyone but lily lily cared great for him  as a friend  and potentially more according to jkr  but the path snape put himself on  the one with the dark arts  turned her away from him it all came to a head when snape called her a mudblood lily ended their friendship there  but snape did nt stop loving her because he loved her  he tried to ask voldemort to spare her  and through that  gave lily an out  which she refused to take but instead protected her son   knowing that snape loved lily so much  dumbledore used that love to get snape on their side when dumbledore asks if snape s feeling are still the same after all this time  snape casts that patronus  lily s patronus had been a doe as well  and tell him  yes  always he s still in this for lily 
9,harrypotter,this is the problem with watching the movies first     read the books asap the movies are fun entertainment but you wo nt get nearly as much out of them as you will out of the books i hope you get to soon and you re enjoying your hp journey  i can try to answer some of your questions  in the books harry goes through some more emotions about dumbledore having known he would need to die ultimately i think he comes out still admiring dumbledore because he knew how hard it was for him and that this was the only choice also  he was going through so many emotions about his own life that being mad at someone else was nt at the top of his mind  i think the jamessnape thing is very much up for debate i ve heard a lot of insightful things on this sub though  the mirror was from sirius he gave it to him as a gift there are two that are connected  the idea being sirius had one and harry had one and they would be able to talk through them   someone correct me if i m wrong but i think aberforth gets the other one after it was stolen from grimmauld place by mundungus  lily is represented by a doe this makes sense because she and james were together and his animagus  and probably patronus  was a stag the patronus is important because it is much stronger evidence that he still loves lily than just saying he does they talk about how only something really powerful emotionally can change a person s patronus  hope this helps other people help me out if i ve missed stuff i m sure i ve messed up a lot of spelling  sorry about that 
10,harrypotter,hi  i got some questions i want to ask about the films i ve never read the books  but i plan to   and i guessed this would be the best place to ask them i m also on mobile so please tell me if the formatting is dodgy  first one is why was nt harry angry at dumbledore after harry died   he saw snape s memory of dumbledore manipulating harry into  raising him as pig to slaughter  yet when he saw him he did nt seem too bothered  in fact he looked like he still admired him  another question is what do you think harry thinks of his father after seeing snape s memory of him  cause to me it looked like he was a bully and stole lilly from him was there something that snape did that gave james the right to do that to him  or was it snape s hate for james that literally changed his memory  where did harry get the mirror shard and where did the mirror even come from  i ve looked through the films and there s no mention of it but then in the deathly hallows harry suddenly has it with no explanation  one more  what is the significance of snape s patronus  i know he loved lilly  but when dumbledore just randomly mentions lilly when he casts the doe  it s not really clear what he means  does he just ask if he loved her  would make sense after snape s  always   thanks guys i do love this subreddit  harry potter is pretty much my favourite film series as i grew up as the same age as harry and the lot  definitely an experience that i loved but did nt know was happening at the time 
11,harrypotter,unless hogwarts employed professor wade wilson  probably not 
12,harrypotter,someone s got  neverending story  in their brain   
13,harrypotter,muggles privy to the wizarding world via a book series  the ministry would be all over that 
14,harrypotter,you ve had too much dragon dust 
15,harrypotter,do you think that these characters knew the readers could  see  what they were doing and sometimes even read their thoughts  the very thought of this has blown my mind   
16,harrypotter,would nt it be crazy if he and harry ended up in the same house  i think it would be gryffindor  to be honest 
17,harrypotter,probably gryffindor
18,harrypotter,i think based on the type of person he looked up to  his mother and father  he would most likely be slytherin
19,harrypotter,a gryffindor  maybe  i m not sure  he s not really brave  he s does nt care about knowledge  he s not a hard worker and he s not cunning  but he may be a gryff because he wants to be praised and desires glory 
20,harrypotter,he s pretty much a muggle crabbe or goyle  so slytherin 
21,harrypotter,gryffindor he s pretty straightforward with everything  and it  was  brave of him to defend harry in front of his parents 
22,harrypotter,international house of pancakes  seriously  though  it s kind of like asking which house of congress kanye west would be better suited for  at any rate  jk has already pointed out that while she briefly considered dudley ending up with a magical child  she ultimately decided that magical blood had no chance of <URL> dursley dna 
23,harrypotter,gryffindor dudley s real crybaby behavior comes out around petunia i think we see the true dudley with the dementors when he thinks harry is performing magic and threats wo nt stop him  he slugs harry then  he gets away wrong direction  but it s the proactive behavior that counts  i agree hufflepuff s a possibility too he was nt a hard worker at 11  but i think that changes when the diet starts he starts so overweight and unhealthy that he feels tired going from the kitchen to the living room a year later  he s a boxing champion who is more muscle than fat that takes hard work 
24,harrypotter,rewatching all the movies  since i just finished the books for the first time   and while watching the sorceressphilosophers stone earlier today i started thinking about the dudley house question when hagrid mistook him for harry i think he could be hufflepuff or maybe even gryffindor 
25,harrypotter,hilarious 
26,harrypotter,genius jvl 
27,harrypotter,lol 
28,harrypotter,breaking news  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said the senate should not confirm a replacement for supreme court justice antonin scalia until after all of the late justice  s horcruxes have been destroyed   a horcrux is a powerful artifact in which a wizard has hidden a piece of his or her soul in hopes of attaining immortality   stated mcconnell  justice scalia  s body may be dead but  by creating horcruxes  dark lord scalia gained the ability to anchor his soul to the earth   it  s not a surprise   said a senior white house official  we  ve known for some time that scalia was inching closer and closer to true immortality as his body withered away  republicans in congress and in the 2016 presidential field united behind mcconnell  contending that the circumstances of scalia  s death  the first horcrux chase since frank murphy famously thrust a dragon  s tooth through the diary of pierce butler before being confirmed  made it necessary to leave the appointment until every piece of scalia  s tangible soul had been vanquished  senate minority leader harry reid lined up firmly behind president obama  the president can and should send the senate a nominee right away   he said in a statement  it would be unprecedented in recent history for a supreme court seat to remain vacant while a team of courageous wizards hunt down the vestiges of scalia  s dark power  calls to honor the tradition of highcourt nominations in spite of the dark wizard  s shadowy tokens were immediately rejected by senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley  riowa   who stated plainly that he has no plans to start up the confirmation process on his panel until the last relics had been quelled   this president  above all others  has made no bones about his goal to use the courts to circumvent the will of dark wizards and push through his own agenda   grassley said  it only makes sense that we wait until the ghostly monuments of his darkness have been dismantled before moving forward  by using his power as chairman to block a vote in committee  grassley can prevent democrats from trying to call up a nomination on the senate floor  at least until every antique carrying the spirit of scalia has been lay waste to  sens rubio of florida and cruz of texas urged mcconnell to block a new confirmation rubio said the nomination could absolutely not occur while the horcruxes remained by threat of armageddon  while cruz bluntly said it is the senate  s duty to slow down a confirmation process until the cold heirlooms of the late justice had been found and eradicated   justice scalia was a dark wizard we owe it to him  amp  the nation  for the senate to ensure that there is no replacement while the power of scalia  s horcruxes remains   cruz said on twitter  wrote this while bored of working hope you enjoyed it  jacob van lunen
29,harrypotter,as an employee there  i ca nt wait to get my first shift on a tech rehearsal day i ve done all my training and i m so excited help all you witches and wizards learn how to greet a hippogriff  the creative team worked so hard to bring this to life the detail is absolutely stunning i ve been on forbidden journey three times now and it is one of the best rides i ve ever been on i d <URL> following  micechat on twitter for updates on when tech rehearsals are happening 
30,harrypotter,i have a facebook friend who works there as a member of the singing frog choir  and she seemed to start training this week she just posted a picture of the whole choir in costume in the park  so they must be getting ready to start that portion soon 
31,harrypotter,in a matter of speaking they are doing a technical run  and almost everything is open up for use by the general public you can go on the rides  get wands  and drink some butterbeer however  i was told that this was subject to change and that they will be open or closed in a random sort of way  but if you have a pass i d say give it a shot and try to see if it s open 
32,starwars,i would hope they d rework some of the controls as well  combat worked fine but movement is painful 
33,starwars,there are pipe dreams and then there s a drug induced coma 
34,starwars, it s not going to last very long     <URL> 
35,starwars,apparently that is  rogwa     <URL>  
36,starwars, rogwa wodrata     <URL>   who is infact female
37,starwars,i ca nt seem to find out his identity does anyone know who this is and what species he is  i took two screenshots  he is on the far left in both     <URL>
38,starwars,i was seeing it the first day it came out so i had a social media blackout between the midnight screenings and the evening when i saw it in a moment of forgetfulness i checked twitter and saw  chewiedies  i thought i had ruined the film for myself  but convinced myself that it was just as easily someone trolling as it could be true the person could ve put that without seeing the movie and still be correct  so i thought nothing of it when i started watching the movie the han solo death was so obviously going to happen from the moment kylo was confirmed to be his son that i was actually hoping that it was a setup and the film was leading you to believe han would die and do a  chewie dies saving him  twist alas this did not happen and i was very disappointed with how predictable the film was so knowing ahead of time that han dies would nt have ruined it for me because i worked it out from the minute the parentage was confirmed 
39,starwars,people guessing and just happen to be right postmovie 
40,starwars,my job puts me in contact with more than a few superfans the unquenchable thirst to be the one that  knows  what happened combined with troll culture creates people who love to ruin the big twist no matter if it was unforeseen or obvious as day it s pretty hard to ignore the internet these days 
41,starwars,that movie s plot point was so obvious i knew it before the teaser trailer was even released it s so hard to talk about it without spoilers but it had to happen  because the actor really wanted it to hell he wanted it in rotj edit  the new trilogy is also a multi year project and the actor in question may not have that much left in him in the process of filming the new movie he was in both a plane crash and a broken ankle 
42,starwars,early showings  script leaks  people on the set  deduction from other leaks so we know that this character is in the movie  but they have no more scenes following this one scene that they were ultrasecretive about yup  we know what happened 
43,starwars,my cousins have a similar story  they were watching a friend s magic showhe spoiled that particular scene  i was lucky to avoid everything sw for three months  outside the teaser trailer  
44,starwars,i had a copy of the script three days before release things get leaked  stills  premiers  advanced screenings  etc 
45,starwars,advanced screenings  production leaks  screener copies getting into the wrong hands  etc  most people are pretty civil  but all it takes is one asshole to ruin it for everyone 
46,starwars,it was released in europe 2 days before it was released in the united states it was available as a lowquality torrent within hours 
47,starwars,before the movie even was released i had the movie s biggest death scene spoiled for me by my fucktard brother  and he had read it somewhere online  facebook   my question is  how are things like this spoiled before the movie is even released 
48,starwars,excluding jacen  jaina  and anakin 
49,starwars,no uncle luke 
50,starwars,is it just me or does leia look a lot more like patame in that picture 
51,starwars,love this  great style little ben is adorable 
52,starwars,not from tcw but my brother and i were watching the phantom menace and decided to take a drink every time jarjar opened his mouth then we decided every other sentence then we chose to live and did every scene where he has a speaking part
53,starwars,drink any time a blaster is fired at a jedi and the shot misses 
54,starwars,oo  another one take a drink whenever someone gets lightsabered through the chest 
55,starwars,rule 2  take a shot for every 100 anonymous clone deaths  that ll empty a bottle in about 5 episodes 
56,starwars,take a sip any time a droid is destroyed 
57,starwars,take a drink any time a jedi dies and everybody acts all sad  but nobody cares when a clone dies 
58,starwars,take a shot any time anakin gets electrocuted 
59,starwars,every time  tcw spoilers   s  fives dies   drink until your liver commits suicide 
60,starwars,i value my liver dude
61,starwars,any time someone fallscrashes and would normally be dead in real life  take a shot 
62,starwars,or ewoks are like 99  of all carnivores on earth  especially the more braindeveloped ones  and do nt eat anything they do nt kill themselves given that they attempted to cook luke and han before killing them  i doubt they d collect and cook alreadydead stormtroopers

154,gameofthrones,they ve all killed each other without acknowledging the  real  enemy amassing north of the wall that s why it s called a  game  of thrones 
155,gameofthrones,i could and would argue that the seven great houses are still in tact meaning they could be a stronger bond than the realm itself living through this rebellion and that  including ww   not saying this is the end game  as i m sure some will actually see its  line end but just a thought  for the moment at least 
156,gameofthrones,i think danny said it best about the  wheel  of all the big 7 houses playing their  game of thrones   she wants to  break the wheel  
157,gameofthrones,daenerys does own lands  meereen  i think
158,gameofthrones,stannis could still be alive 
159,gameofthrones,i have a theory that there are too many theoretical theories going around  how s that for a theory 
160,himym,next time i watch himym all the way through  i m skipping the last 10 minutes of the finale and watching this
161,himym,i have nt and will never watch the finale this show ends on the wedding day for me 
162,himym,main issue from my point of view  is that show s title and season 9  which should nt have happened  but extended due to shows  popularity  raised audiences expectations about the mother we sympathized for the mother due to her frequent appearances in s9  if i accept this alternate ending as the true ending  then i would feel just terrible for robin from the beginning  creators wanted robin to end up with ted i spent <SMILE> years watching her getting along with the group instead  she ended up alone  regretting her decisions  cast aside  and prob live alone forever 
163,himym,this ending is so much better the original ending was just a slap in the face <SMILE> years of building up a character for nothing we already moved pass robin and ted they are nt for each other why force it  then the kids getting all perky and hyper right after their dad was talking about their dead mother  does nt fit the show at all title is  how i met your mother  not aunt whoever decided to use the original ending failed at their job makes me happy  how i met your dad  is nt going to happen hell they even screwed up the title on that one 
164,himym,why could nt we just have this    
165,himym,this still does nt make me happy i feel sad when i think about how robin is barley part of the group anymore  i need this fixed and then i will be okay 
166,himym,i like this  but it makes a lot of scenes from the show meaningless  and also cuts out a lot of great scenes the ending we got was the ending we were always supposed to get  and i think it fits the show perfectly sure it could have been executed better  like giving barney and robin s marriage more time on the show  but otherwise i think it worked out great 
167,himym,way better than the blue french horn ending i m all for the yellow umbrella
168,himym,i prefer the emotional roller coaster of the original ending this is too fairly tale 
169,himym,this used to be my favorite show it was my background noise whenever i did nt have anything to watch  or do  i would put how i met your mother on and just let it play i loved the show  i loved the characters  i loved everything about it i can not count how many times i ve watched it through until the finale i m not arguing a side of how it should have ended it just left a bitter taste in my mouth i ve never had something like that happen before i have nt been able to bring myself to watch it since it ended because i just could nt believe how it all ended up and again  i m not arguing one way or the other  but the originally ending tarnished such a great feeling in my memory and it may be stupid to some  but some of you may understand on a personal level this ending just feels right  and i do nt think i would be bitter about it i do nt care that he ended up with robin i just feel cheated to have been given such an amazing perfect character to only have it all taken away in such a quick impersonal way and i guess that may be the point life cheats you  life does nt care how you ve invested yourself it goes on whether you like it or not but seeing this  for the first time btw  gave me those feelings i used to have for the show again maybe i can start over again and like it the way i used to wow i ve been ranting sorry about that 
170,himym,perfect 
171,himym,my ideal season 9 would ve been the finale  just stretched over 24 episodes  i think it should have been flashbacks to the wedding over the 17 years that the finale covered then the divorce would ve been a good mid season finale  and we would have been able to enjoy some of the better moments of the finale and probably had better closure with tm s death 
172,himym,but the real question is  is it white and gold or blue and black 
173,himym,so what does it say about your brain if you see a duck first vs seeing a rabbit first 
174,himym,i m sorry to be that guy but this image is extremely well known  at least around where i m from   i had seen it at least five or six times in various elementarymiddle schoolhigh school classes before i watched himym
175,himym,not sure if you re serious  these have been the exact names of maltomeal s brand knockoffs for decades 
176,himym,here is what the linked meme says in case it is blocked at your schoolwork or is unavailable for any reason      himym finale fail roll    gt     post title      how the himym writers came up with that finale  gt     top      ted s met the mother what do you do now   gt     bottom      end the show with the happy ending everyone wants    original link  1     <URL>    meme template  2     <URL> 
177,himym,towards the end of the race i noticed  when barney  ted and robin meet up right before they get to gregors from the way the three of them met up again  wouldnt robin have been there basically the same time it took them to meet on the corner before the last stretch when barney tackled ted  so why did she just run to gregors and win much sooner  obviously this is digging pretty far into the  why  factor but i just became very curious

179,himym,i ca nt see  the ballad of sir frankie crisp  by george harrisons
180,himym,got ta add heaven by the walkmen on there
181,himym,i have that song on my list but i do nt remember where i pulled it from 
182,himym,simple song is on there it s one of my favorites off the list
183,himym,does nt even have the theme in it   <URL>  v  zqypufdndb0
184,himym,you could add  here i dreamt i was an architect  by the decemberists and  forest whitaker  by bad books
185,himym,i could nt find nothing suits you like a suit either to clarify i did nt make the playlist just found it and thought i d share
186,himym,no  simple song  
187,himym,la vie en rose mom plays on ukelele
188,himym,no murder train 
189,himym,this entire playlist should have been  im gon na be  on an infinite loop as a gag
190,himym,you could add the funeral  by band of horses  i think it s in s<SMILE>e1 
191,himym,i agree with you op i just started watching himym last week and i ca nt stand ted  lilly and sometimes marshall  ted is just a massive pseudointellectual douche he s so mean to people  ca nt make mature decisions and when he likes a girl he just falls crazy in love and ca nt take no for an answer  it s not realistic at all especially when he does some bad things to his partners  especially robin  yet it s okay because he was reacting to something they did which is complete bs  lilly also pisses me off because she thinks she s always right and dishing out justice for the group based on some sick moral compass she does some pretty horrible things to ted too  like the episode where she calls him to ditch his date  to change her tyre in the middle of nowhere and then leave him then not call and expect everything to go back to normal and she bloody hits barney a lot  ftm violence is just as bad  i do nt care if people find it funnynot that i can see how she also ca nt keep secrets  ruins relationships and is a terrible person  just like ted is to some girls  robin and marshall are okay but not as bad now barney definitely does douchey things constantly  but i feel for him because he s the odd one out in the group always getting picked on  and i think we can only pity him because we know his sense of confidence is exaggerated and artificial based on some deeper issues in his past that he has nt dealt with and his fragile emotions  so that s why ted  lilly  evil and barney  awesome

221,mylittlepony, i should probrably not get sucked into this but i ll just go for it anyway and see what happens no regrets yet  it s really a shame when people throw out all of there work  and leave no evidence or context of what happened  i know she is hurt  but i know idea why we can sit hear and get all emotional about it  or move on because she s cut down her lines of communication down to one last video and what is now possibly a dead channel  all in all there is nothing to see here or do  for all who think i m being a jerk ok sure  i d say she is already long gone and will never come back  she already cause this much selfdestruction  her best option is really not to come back and just have fun doing something else  she sounds young and not mature enough to handle the demands of her audience 13ksubs like that can be alot of pressure the demands she could have made for herself and the regular online nasty that comes with ever increasing exposure  what she really needs is a good talking to which does nt seem possible anymore unless she steps forward  begging her to come back wo nt make things better it makes things complicated and it s not good for what seems to me a formative experience  and op ugreninjasheik1 gt  who would do such a thing to her  really  tier 1 shit concerns  it actually does nt matter anymore  nor should we care who or what kind of person did whatever they did  what matter is how to help  secondly it sounds like from what she said  i ve done some things i ve said some things  that she is taking some fault and responsiblity of something or anything and with  they ve been circling around  it also seems like her trust has been betrayed  chances are she connected her youtube channel and twitter account too close to her personal life and has reaped the consequences of having such a set up for convenience  something that kids would do without thinking too much into it  actually with all this said i realize that i m wasting my time  gg game over she is nt coming back  why should we care like really   nobody can help other than spam her with consolation to her now dead channel     discordgrump     walkingabout  i m out

226,startrek,enterprise is a great place to start it s a nice introduction to the universe of star trek then go to tng  then ds9 then voyager 
227,startrek,it depends on whether you like scifi or action if you re an action movie fan and do nt care about writing  then the new stuff 
228,startrek,tng is what my dad started me on as a kid i d <URL> starting the even though i grew up on it  i ll openly admit that it can get kinda cheesy here and there 
229,startrek,i d start with next gen  personally as i kid i got into the original series by watching the movies  then went back and watched the show 
230,startrek,you are a new fan because you saw what  i started with star trek 2009  then went to season 1 episode 1 tng but as a general rule  star trek is a tv series  the movies are more like an appendage  p i still <URL> having a go at st 2009 before going into the series tho  because is fun  but what you will get in the series is so much better 
231,startrek,probably star trek  the next generation  tos might be a bit hard to watch as it shows its age in places  that s not saying people should nt watch it   i do nt think you d get a complete idea of what star trek is supposed to be about from the other series 
232,startrek,if you must do movies  i d do out of order  star trek iv  the voyage home first  just to get them interested  you know it s a pretty standard adventure and you do nt really need all the backstory  yet   once you got them interested  do a marathon st2st3st4 i personally is extremely  meh  on st5 
233,startrek,all these other comments are good  but to answer your question i highly <URL> wrath of khan it s widely considered the best star trek film  and it s easy to get into since it was written as a movie for general audiences  thus you do nt really need to watch space seed before watching the movie   it was my first introduction to trek and it worked for me 
234,startrek,the movies are based on characters and stories that were built up from the tv series i would actually <URL> trying the next generation tv series  and go through the guides others have posted do nt be afraid to skip bad episodes in the first couple seasons i wrote a personalized opinion  here     <URL>  context  3  a few weeks ago about which episodes were most important to watch in the first couple seasons i stand behind my assessment  if you really want to go with a film  just watch the first of the 2009 series do nt watch into darkness until much later  because it kind of ruins things that happened in one of the actual best films in the franchise if you enjoy the 2009 film  go back to the original series  watch the episode space seed  and any of the other good ones  there are lists all over the web of the best of tos   then start with star trek 2  the wrath of khan  and just finish that series off 5 is skippable  it s a pretty bad film altogether the motion picture is also skippable  it s not a great film either and it s really dense unless you re deep into the trek universe it s worth watching at some point  but it really is  bad 2001  a space odyssey 
235,startrek,i have to agree with the others  the heart and soul of star trek is the various tv series  the movies are just a bonus the movies are mostly action focused and tend to revolve around evil villains who are up to no good and must be stopped  which is a poor reflection of what the franchise has to offer as a whole  the original series from the 60s is the true starting point  but it can be difficult for a modern viewer to get into the next generation is the gentlest entry point as it s not quite as dated  but be aware that its first two seasons are a bit sucky deep space nine is my personal favourite  and is generally well regarded by fans  but it s best watched after having seen tng voyager and enterprise have some good qualities  but probably are nt the best place to start 
236,startrek,although i agree with the answers you ve received  trek is really about the tv shows  and tng is probably the best place to start  just be warned that the first 2 seasons of tng are nt exactly great tv   i think it s worth actually answering the question in the title of your post  if you really want to start with the movies  watch the original series movies  ivi   i and v are not universally liked  but the rest are good  and will give you a reasonable idea of what star trek is about  sadly  the tng movies are not very good  the reboot movies are good action movies but do nt really represent star trek 
237,startrek,  <URL> but do nt start with movies in general the heart of star trek is tv start with them 
238,startrek,star trek is a tv franchise with film spinoffs your best option would be starting with tos or tng    <URL> i started watching trek last october with tos  and i d <URL> starting from there if you can get past the 60s feel and slowpaced storytelling  it s the show that started it all then you can continue on with the films and shows in  the correct order  you see in the guide above  if it s too dated for you  start with tng the first two seasons are rough  but season 3 and on is great every trek series after tos takes about two seasons to find its footing  so give them a chance before giving up  here s a more detailed guide i d <URL> also giving a read basically expands on what i just said    <URL>
239,startrek,hey everyone  i m completely foreign to the star trek i was wondering what series i should start with the old movies   ivi  the next generation   19942002  the reboot series   2009present  or what tv series 
240,startrek,see  i was interested  but then i saw it was not the enterprisee 
241,startrek,why ncc1701   a    i could understand the original or d  but why a 
242,startrek,can we just start calling drones what they really are  toys they re rc toys 
243,startrek,so the quad is in the saucer section  i assumed the stardrive section has the electronics and battery that means the entire thing is horribly unbalanced  and probably terrible to fly 
244,startrek,is there any video of this in action 
245,startrek,so even wesley crusher can fly it 
246,startrek,mmmmm and it s a connie refit never more happy that i clicked a link 
247,startrek,i got this  data took the test when everyone else was on summer holidays  since  as an android  he does nt really take vacation so he thought he d do something more concrete and useful  d
248,startrek,fun backstage anecdote  troi was given a standard uniform by the costume department  and only then did the writers start writing her into stories where she got to drive the plot by being competent  dress for the job you want 
249,startrek,it might be that the bridge officers test is something specific for officers and personnel that are not on a command  operations  or science track since troi and crusher are the only two we have canonical evidence of having taken the test  it might be one of many additional certifications an already commissioned officer can study and attain  analogous to how cadets at starfleet medical academy can take engineering extension courses  and likewise  crusher and troi s rank and promotions  as officers separate from the standard officer track  their promotion to commander should probably be considered differently as a medical rank and is not really analogous to a commander in command  operations  or sciences 
250,startrek,you have it wrong the real question is  did the command test come with a  crash  course for starship piloting 
251,startrek,you have to remember that in any entertaining story they have to skip the uninteresting parts it s possible that data did have a similar experience but it was nt particularly challenging for him so they did nt bother to tell that story instead the show focuses more on data s struggle with basic human interactions 
252,startrek,i think it s because troi is a counselor  and had no command training in her background 
253,startrek,bit off topic  but reading some of the comments  it makes me wonder how on voyager  from the start in the alpha quadrant  their head of operations was an ensign  surely there were more qualified people than harry out of the whole of starfleet to be the new operations manager 
254,startrek,i think it s got to do with how the line of command works  troi and doctor crusher were both medicalline officers  and so they did nt automatically have authority over people outside of their departments except in medical and psychological matters  there was probably some starfleet regulations which made it that medical officers could nt be put in command unless they demonstrated to the captain or the xo that they were capable of it  i do nt think this was as big a deal for officers in the engineering  operations or security departments over the course of their careers  they were more likely to be put in charge of away teams or small teams to do things onboard so  over the course of the years  they d gain experience commanding small numbers of people and would eventually be allowed to command larger numbers of people  even wesley was put in charge of a science group for that one episode  i m thinking it was called pen pals  i might be wrong   this was because he was being trained for a commandline position in the long run chances are that  had he chosen to stay in starfleet  he would nt have had to take the same kind of command test that troi had  or if he did  it would have only been a formality  this was nt really the case for people in the medical department they were stuck doing medical work in sickbay for the most part because that was their job  i think the command test was probably designed mostly for people from the medical line who decided they wanted command of a ship eventually the promotion to full commander was probably just an honourary thing  and did nt automatically put them in the ship s line of command unless the captain decided that would be the case  the real test for people who wanted to gain their own command would be the kobayashi maru test  or something similar to it even for someone who d been in the command line their entire career  it s hard to know how they re going to respond to that kind of situation unless they re tested for it  so they give them the simulation  the test troi took would probably have been considered a kobayashi maru for people in the medical line 
255,startrek,probably based on their fields  operations officer would be assumed to need some basic bridge command lessons but not so much with the ships counselor
