0,harrypotter,that white line at the end must be the kings cross scene with dumbledore 
1,harrypotter,i have regrettably not kept up with all of the information that has been added to the hp world since the books were finished  in the next few years i would love to reread the whole series  but it would be really fun to have all of the new information interjected throughout with asides  footnotes  etc  thoughts 
2,harrypotter,yes  i saw a new version of the annotated alice in wonderland the other day  and it s amazing  it s like a huge illustrated version  similar in sizeshape to the illustrated harry potter and the sorcerer s stone   but the actual story is written on like 13 of each page  with extra information and paragraphs and illustrations in the empty parts designwise  it s beautiful  and it s such a cool way to read the book  but it would have to be very wellthought out as far as what information is revealed when  
3,harrypotter,it would break the flow of the story the only way to add it is by pulling a tolkien and putting all the pottermore stuff in a post dhending appendices they could also add some extensive family trees of the main characters 
4,harrypotter,this was my bulletin board for the month too  p   <URL>
5,harrypotter,you are the type of ra i hope i can be if i manage to get selected  my current ras are great guys  but they did a great gatsby theme instead of harry potter 
6,harrypotter,probably the best book to movie adaptation that s ever been released  at least imo 
7,harrypotter,awesome drawing 
8,harrypotter,wait til my father here s about this 
9,harrypotter,i feel there was nt enough in the movies actually it seems worse in the movies because all the pranks and fighting back against her  catharsis  fireworks  weasleys  is nt in the movie until just before they go to the ministry and the decrees were in higher number so i imagine in the film s universe it felt a lot worse whereas in the books it would ve been better 
10,harrypotter,wow  that s so well done  i can draw a good outlet  
11,harrypotter,wow  did you do this yourself  
12,harrypotter,its a mad house    a mad house    
13,harrypotter,i do nt know why it took me this long to notice this  but the name  hermione  is a derivative from hermes  but not necessarily from hermes the greek messenger god of trickery  trade  theft  heroes  and of course communication  hermes was merged with mercury by the romans   for the greeks had other gods named hermes  hermione s name fits all too well with the syncretic god hermes trismegastis  hermes trismegastis  famed deity for which the hermaneutic method is named  is thought by many scholars to be a syncretic divinity combining the greek god hermes with the egyptian god thoth the ancient greeks had noticed that both gods were gods of magic and scribes  and other forms of written communication   ie bookish they both were psychopomps  divine figures who escort others to the afterlife or the underworld hermes trismegastis combined within him hermes  godhood over communication and heroism and thoth s godhood over astrology  alchemy  and wisdom  it seems fitting that hermione could be named after the syncretic god of scribes  magic  heroism  and wisdom  on the other hand  although jk is known for her clever naming of characters in the harry potter stories  this could also be simply a pleasant convenience  i ve googled about this and found nothing to tell me one way or the other  does anyone know 
14,harrypotter,definitely  and then all of the things she happily does under voldemort s ministry regime later on she s a horrifying and disgusting person  and every bit as bad as the death eaters 
15,harrypotter,can i have your talent please   this is amazing 
16,harrypotter,i ve heard there was a parseltongue in gryffindor once 
17,harrypotter,unless hogwarts employed professor wade wilson  probably not 
18,harrypotter,in regard to your comment about being unable to learn parseltongue  i think it is possible to animal languages at least to be understood by those who are not natural speakers  dumbledore himself understands parseltongue   i d think owl language would be the most useful in the wizarding world it s so natural for owls to be seen about  so they d make the perfect observers and spies 
19,harrypotter,the top comment in this  thread     <URL>  suggests that parseltongues could be magically attenuated to speaking to snakes  however elsewhere on this reddit and i believe jkr herself said it can not be learned we know genetics  of sorts  plays into it some  so are there natural felinetongues  aviriatoungues  rodentiatongues that we do nt know about out there  of course i m asking for wild speculation here as the canon does nt talk about it much and seems to keep parseltongues on par with voldy so no character wants to explore it in the books for fear of being named a deatheater or whatever irrational nonsense comes to mind 
20,harrypotter,hitching on to this train of thought  would animagi be able to speak the tongue of the animal they can transform into  ie mcgonagall can talk to cats  sirius to dogs  etc  
21,harrypotter,all of these questions are answered by the books  and some answered might be a little spoilery for some aspects that the movies never went into if you d rather not have any further spoilers  please stop reading here  a this is complicated and is actually a long overarcing thread in the last book through out the book  harry  at many points  feels very frustrated with dumbledore and the amount of secrets he kept from harry however he also comes to see that mostly when dumbledore was keeping secrets  it was as a benefit to harry it might not be something harry liked  but it was something he needed eventually  harry makes a decision to trust in dumbledore s judgement and sort of comes to accept that he can not always know everything and that sometimes he needs to not act  which is enormously hard for him   when he sees those memories  he does think about dumbledore s betrayal  but it feels to him as a minor thing against the knowledge that he has to die  gt  slowly  very slowly  he sat up  and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was  brain and nerve and bounding heart  it would all be gone    or at least  he would be gone from it his breath came slow and deep  and his mouth and throat were completely dry  but so were his eyes  gt  dumbledore  s betrayal was almost nothing of course there had been a bigger plan  harry had simply been too foolish to see it  he realized that now  the thing is that harry does see the sense of it he understands why dumbledore did what he did  and he understands why he is the one who has to die  and if it is him  then nobody else has to at this point  harry s emotions are a huge mess he is in a great state of shock and wanting to live but knowing he can not  so anger is not at the forefront of his brain eventually when he meets dumbledore  after being killed  by voldemort  the shock has worn off  but he is still mostly confused  which keeps him from feeling anger it also helps that pretty much one of the first things dumbledore tells him is that he is not exactly dead then dumbledore goes on to explain and apologises to harry  with tears in his eyes  which helps harry understand that everything dumbledore did  he did nt do for the funsies he made these decisions because they were the best ones  but they were nt easy or kind  not even on dumbledore himself  which is what helps harry come to peace with them  honestly  the books go way more in depth with harry s feelings re  dumbledore than anyone could ever do in a simple post  so i very much urge you to read them it will help clarify a lot  b when harry first finds out about the bully james was in the past  it actually bothers him a lot there is quite a chunk of the fifth book that deals with harry thinking about what he saw in the pensive and his father s behaviour he does quite a dangerous thing  using umbridge s fire to talk to sirius and lupin  just to get more information on his father s behaviour eventually he learns to give it a place he still loves his father  obviously  but he thinks of him with slightly less blind idealism still  from all accounts  it does seem like james  honestly  changed  and snape was nt exactly innocent in all of it either  james and snape pretty much continuously hexed each other  so it is not like james is an unrepenting douchebag either he s a person who made douchy choices as a teen  but also made a lot of good ones during that same time of his life  who eventually grew out of it  which is sort of how harry comes to remember him  c in the order of the phoenix  after christmas  sirius gives harry one of a pair of twoway mirrors but does nt explain them they are basically like mirror walkietalkies  that sirius and james used to use to talk to each other in detention harry  realising it is a way to contact sirius  fears that doing so will make sirius do something stupid and dangerous and puts them in the bottom of his trunk he forgets about them  even when he needs them most after sirius s death  harry remembers the mirror  however because sirius is dead  he can not use them anymore still  he does nt get rid of it it eventually shatters  but harry keeps the biggest piece the second mirror  the one that belonged to sirius is found by mundungus when he is looting sirius s house for stuff to sell he sells that mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother  who realises what is aberforth uses the mirror to keep an eye on harry  it is his blue eye harry sees  and eventually uses it to send dobby to them when they are in great danger  d snape loved lily snape has never loved anyone but lily lily cared great for him  as a friend  and potentially more according to jkr  but the path snape put himself on  the one with the dark arts  turned her away from him it all came to a head when snape called her a mudblood lily ended their friendship there  but snape did nt stop loving her because he loved her  he tried to ask voldemort to spare her  and through that  gave lily an out  which she refused to take but instead protected her son   knowing that snape loved lily so much  dumbledore used that love to get snape on their side when dumbledore asks if snape s feeling are still the same after all this time  snape casts that patronus  lily s patronus had been a doe as well  and tell him  yes  always he s still in this for lily 
22,harrypotter, felinetongues  filch  ms figg   just kidding  althought it would be awesome 
23,harrypotter,i think parseltongue can be a learned language ron used it to open up the chamber of secrets in the last book he may not have known what it meant and it took him a few times  but he did do it 
24,harrypotter,not to mention the weasleys  potters  and longbottoms listed in there they were women marrying men but one or more of their children could take  or be given  the family name black just to keep it going it s not totally improbable  edit  cleaned up a bit
25,harrypotter,the only thing wrong with that tree is that andromeda black married ted tonks who was muggle  born   not a muggle 
26,harrypotter,i think taking to cat is called redditortongues
27,harrypotter,1  i totally forget how harry reacts after he sees the memories i think maybe he just sits down and cries for a bit  it was a lot to take in  2  snape kicks harry out of the dungeons after that lesson iirc  harry basically runs out of the dungeons and ends up on some stairs feeling nauseous about how he just saw his father behave  25  sirius and james had started to bully snape on the hogwarts express before they had even gotten sorted yet both james and sirius came from money and gave snape crap for wanting to be in slytherin house  like his mother eileen was   so  snape did not instigate the bullying by fifth year  snape was very much into the dark arts and was hanging around shady people and james was about to stop being such an arse all the time from snape s point of view  james stole her from lily s point of view  snape had <URL> toxic and james was a changed man calling her a mudblood was the last straw and she cut snape out of her life and james and her clicked and they started dating  snape s memory did nt change what james didwas james grew up and matured  3  in order of the phoenix   at 12 grimmauld during the christmas holidays i think   sirius gives harry a package and tells him if he ever should need to be in contact  to use what s in the package harry has just seen a spat between snape and sirius and does not want to be the reason sirius ends up getting killed so  harry never opens the package  which contained the mirror shard he  does  open the package  after  sirius has died and feels like an idiot for not having opened it sooner mundungus feltcher ends up stealing stuff from grimmauld place after sirius dies he ends up selling the other half of the mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother who owns the hog s head tavern   so  when harry keeps seeing bright blue eyes in the mirror during deathly hallows  it s actually aberforth keeping a watchful eye on harry in case he needs help  4  dumbledore had just asked snape if he had grown to care about harry snape casts his patronus it s a doe just like lily s patronus was a doe dumbledore realizes that snape is still fighting for lily  lily after all this time   snape replies  always   in that snape had always loved lily in that he never stopped  or will stop  loving her 
28,harrypotter,what a great question  imagine being able to talk to your dog or cat  jk needs to clear this up  
29,harrypotter,you ve had too much dragon dust 
30,harrypotter,do you think that these characters knew the readers could  see  what they were doing and sometimes even read their thoughts  the very thought of this has blown my mind   
31,harrypotter,but ca nt a patronus only be an animal  would a dementor be considered one 
32,harrypotter,this is the first time i ve seen it  and i got a medium to large giggle out of it  
33,harrypotter,to me this isnt a big deal sirius was like the good apple in a tree of rotten ones being sad thats theres no more blacks is like being sad the hitler family ended when bill hitler was an animal rights activist dont get me wrong hitlers the hitlers are horrible but dont be sad that a racist family tree is ended be sad that good guy died
34,harrypotter,i swear  dolores umbridge s patronus should be a dementor instead of a cat _ 
35,harrypotter,i have already read all of the potter books multiple times  but it s been a few years and i was looking to do so again as a frequent member of book clubs  i thought it could be enjoyable to find someone to read along with this seemed a good place to find someone for that   so if you like the idea and would nt mind taking the journey with a 37yearold fella  send me a message or write on kik to iamhereiguess
36,harrypotter,ha  i never thought of that nice 
37,harrypotter,you could always join us over at rdueling for harry potter trivia 
38,harrypotter,my guess is dementors would stay the hell away from anyone who they made happy 
39,harrypotter,when i first read dh s king cross chapter i had a  ahha  moment to the triumph look    this was probably the most talked about moment during the long summer  period between gof and ootp   well second most talked about after shipping of course i think some fans even asked jkr about it during a qamp  a session but she could nt give an answer  the fact i still remember it while reading dh for the first time in 2007 shows you how big it was 
40,harrypotter,yeah  that is an awesome moment i really love rereading  or listening to  the books and picking up on hints like that one that are woven throughout the series another great foreshadowing moment is the scene in order of the phoenix  after harry has the vision of mr weasley being attacked  and they re in dumbledore s office   dumbledore watched the smoke closely  his brow furrowed  and after a few seconds  the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the aira serpent s head grew out of the end of it  opening its mouth wide harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story  he looked eagerly at dumbledore for a sign that he was right  but dumbledore did not look up  naturally  naturally  murmured dumbledore apparently to himself  still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise but in essence divided   harry could make neither head nor tail of this question the smoke serpent  however  split itself instantly into two snakes  both coiling and undulating in the dark air with a look of grim satisfaction dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand  the clinking noise slowed and died  and the smoke serpents grew faint  became a formless haze  and vanished    ootp pg 470 in the american edition  this was most likely dumbledore working out his theory that a piece of voldemort s soul was living in harry i ve always wondered at what  exact  point in the series dumbledore realized and admitted to himself that harry had to die in order for voldemort to be defeated  and to see if his behavior towards harry changed at all as a result but i guess if he figured out in book four that voldemort s act of taking harry s blood might mean an ultimate triumph for him  it would nt have affected him as much so many questions   also  <URL> to rharrypotter  i m incredibly new here as well and am so glad i finally found this place 
41,harrypotter,this is making me want to reread them all again i only finished them for the 6th time a few months ago lol also  i chuckled out loud at the  riddled  pun   well done  golf clap 
42,harrypotter,it is also interesting to note how this passage foreshadows dumbledore s story line in future books up until this moment harry sees dumbledore as this infallible perfect god who always knows what to do and always has the right answer to all the issues as described in previous books and the beginning of fourth book this comes as a contrast to the fact that he is one of the people he thinks of after he has the dream at the beginning about voldemort killing frank bryce  he is the one he runs when he sees mad crouch and he is the one he wants to talk to after witnessing voldemort torturing wormtail  however the fact that he is tired and concerned shows us how human he actually is the glimpse of triumph of course indicates that he is as lucid and intelligent as always with very strong deductive skills but from now on he would proceed to make severe mistakes in book five  by choosing to keep harry and sirius out of the loop  he indirectly is responsible for sirius s death not to mention book six where we truly get to see a weakened dumbledore as he is dying from a curse which he accidentally put on himself it all culminates with book seven where we learn about his past  his involvement with grindelwald and his part in the death of his sister 
43,harrypotter,thought i d share this with you guys i own one of several pairs of glasses made for the film  harry potter and the philosopher s stone  i was given these when i was <SMILE> in 2002 by simon murray  the spectacle maker   here s a few photos     <URL>  cool huh

48,harrypotter,hell  bro i would nt be mad fawcett s hot  
49,harrypotter, detention  as well  mr stebbins     <URL> 
50,harrypotter,missing  apparel  couple of tshirts  a scarf  and a pair of shoes   the book jacket for sorcerer s stone  ruined in a move and need to find a new one   and deathly hallows pt 2 dvd because my boss borrowed it 
51,harrypotter,i think it would look good if you hade cuts in your hand in red ink that spell sectumsempra
52,harrypotter,got mine a while back but here s a  photo     <URL>  from when it was fresh  the death s head moth is a representation of life and death and how they are deeply entwined throughout the series

56,harrypotter,your movies are out of order  p
57,harrypotter,buzzfeed article  here     <URL>  ci3obbgxol 
58,harrypotter,the photographer is a friend of mine and these pictures were shot at  kalap trust     wwwkalaptrustorg   india featuring kids in the region having some fun in the hills 
59,harrypotter,anybody have a cool sirius black tattoo or idea for one that they want to share  i ve thought about getting his prison number for years  but alas  i am empty when it comes to ink thanks 
60,harrypotter,what s that framed print in the back  where can i buy it 
61,harrypotter,the only horcruxes we know about were tom s  but he made some interesting choicesmistskes nagini and harry are living things  would they have lived forever had part of tom s soul never been destroyed  these two horcruxes raise more questions do horcruxes have to be solid  what about liquid  a plasma or a gas  do they have to matter at all  what about an electromagnetic field  or a photon  is there a size limit  could the moon be a horcrux  or the indian ocean  of course this is all purely academic 
62,harrypotter,interesting read i would think that it could be argued that snape and pettigrew were in those house because that s where they wanted to be and not necessarily where they ought to be and the same can be said for other students  remember that the sorting hat takes people s opinion or want into consideration  i would think that s why most people are sorted into houses based on where they re relatives were 
63,harrypotter,holy hippogriffs  this is awesome  d  
64,harrypotter,i do nt think the sorting hat puts you in the house you re best suited to but rather what you aspire to be on your points  1  on potter more about the sorting hat it says that peter pettigrew narrowly escaped slytherin when the hat was in him so maybe he asked to be put in gryffindor  not unlike harry  i would argue though that despite being cowardly which led him to betraying james and lily i do think he had some courage he stayed with voldemort for a year he could ve easily abandoned himchopped off his right handkill 13 muggles in the middle of the street and risked getting caught but managed to escapei mean sure they were motivated by cowardice but i would say fear makes you do courageous things and that was what pettigrew did other traits of gryffindor was being courageous and recklessnot just bravery so again despite being pushed by cowardice and self serving  slytherin traits  he still did pretty reckless things  i do know that he is definitely not a hufflepuffnot with his actions of treacheryhufflepuffs are nt the leftover house you got ta be loyal unfortunately peter wasnt  2  i agree with this percy was ambitious enough to get in good with the ministryalthough i do wonder in ootp did percy believe the ministry s lies or did he know it was all fake but did nt care because he wanted to stay in their good books  what do you think   at the end of the deathly hallows he ran away from the ministry to join and fight with his family that could be said to be brave and i think so because he was a pureblood at the time he was protected by his status at the ministry and be still went back to his family but at the same time i do nt think it was brave because i think percy was forced to kish away because they would ve been after him to ask about his family and any sane wizard or witch at the time could realize the ministry was at its all time lowvoldemort low not fudge and umbridge low   3  dumbledore is a tricky one i always thought that with his master chess game he was playing he would ve been the perfect slytherinlol i think dumbledore is wayyyyyy more cunning than voldemort or even slughorn although like in point one i made about pettigrewthe same could be said for dumbledore despite slythering his way through the war he took pretty big risks that relied heavily on chance that s pretty gryffindor to me i think if there was nt a war going on ravenclaw would be his best fit he was a wise old man after all  4  conclusion  i like that the characters were not clean cut caricatures of their houses they re human  the world is nt split into black and white every character in the series could be argued to demonstrate qualities of each of the houses it gives them depth  5  bonus  i think voldemort would ve made a good gryffindor  his actions were even more daring than dumbledore both while he was at school  chamber of secrets fiasco  and when he became the official dark lord ps  its spelled grindelwald
65,harrypotter,dumbledore being in slytherin would be a great twist and excellent way of saying  see  there are good people in slytherin  
66,harrypotter,i think that when it comes to where the sorting hat places you  it ultimately comes down to who you are aspiring to be in that moment think about when harry was sorted if it had been completely up to the sorting hat  harry would have been placed in slytherin just as harry told his son at the end of book 7  the hat goes with your choice above all other aspects it weighs in so whoever your 11yearold self believes he or she is or should be  that is where the hat sorts you another good example is the sorting hat s placement of malfoy i love how it is demonstrated in the movie  the hat barely touches malfoy s head and he is immediately sent to slytherin this is because he has been raised by a family bursting with pureblood and slytherin pride  and this is who he aspires to be as well  i hope this make sense  but in the end  i really believe that the sorting hat does nt choose the house for you  you choose the house for you 
67,harrypotter,seems like the sorting hat has a pretty clear algorithm  1  you a dick  yes  slytherin  no  2  you brave  yes  gryffindor  no  3  you smart  yes  ravenclaw  no  hufflepuff  case studies  malfoy dick  yup does nt matter that he s smart  he fixed the vanishing cabinet  props for that   hermione dick  nope brave  yup does nt matter that she s brilliant  she gets gryffindor   harry dick  apparently enough to confuse the hat  but borderline brave  alright  gryffindor  counterpoints  cedric seems not a dick  brave and smart  which would put him in gryffindor  so to answer your question  cedric obvious algorithm malfunction 
68,harrypotter,for context  my university offers a program of studentfacilitated classes  which includes a class on harry potter  yes  you do get units   for our end of the year project  a girl in my class made these tarot cards  and i thought they were too beautiful not to share she made seven  but i only got to take pictures of two and one of the back of the cards they were all amazing and i wish she sold them 
69,harrypotter,uowlpostagain  umirgaine_life  ucoledarling i need this you guys let s make it happen 
70,harrypotter,that article was awesome
71,harrypotter,i agree with everything you posted i would also add crabbe and goyle in slytherin  they did nt really show ambition at all and they just did what malfoy told them to do  however  i do nt think they fit into any of the houses also zacharias smith has no hufflepuff traits that are shown in the books i think he would ve been better suited for any other house 
72,harrypotter,hey can you ship a nutella frozen hot chocolate to me 
73,harrypotter,does it taste like bitterness and regret 
74,harrypotter,mmm  mm   oily 
75,harrypotter,i live in the area  so i ll have to check it out 
76,harrypotter,too bad they misspelled pensieve 
77,harrypotter,i feel like snape would have preferred it stayed the lily crepe 
78,harrypotter,i love that place i wish i still lived in boston so i could go there  
79,harrypotter,where s the actual crepe 
80,harrypotter,ok i lost my shit pretty bad on this one saved it to my desktop for future laughs lol
81,harrypotter, link to previous chapter     <URL>    synopsis   bellatrix and narcissa arrive at snape s house narcissa wants to talk to him bella is trying to stop her she thinks snape is a traitor they arrive at his door and snape <URL> them in snape bullies wormtail a bit then bellatrix questions snape about whose side he is on he is able to explain away all her questions then narcissa has a chance to air her worry draco has been given a task by the dark lord narcissa thinks he ll die in the attempt she asks snape to do it instead of draco she makes him swear the unbreakable vow to protect draco and carry out the deed should he fail    poi    bellatrix kills a fox here but she does nt say avada kedavra which suggests that it can be used non verbally given the number of times other people use it and say the incantation  you kinda get the impression that it can only be used verbally but this would suggest otherwise   bellatrix says that snape lives in a  muggle dunghill   but considering that hogsmeade is the only fully wizard village in britain  would nt most wizards live in towns predominantly muggle  unless you live in the middle of nowhere   this home that snape lives in is the same home he grew up in why on earth would he stay there  he has no love for that house at all he hated his father he resented his mother his childhood there was awful why stay at spinner s end  for me  it would be like sirius wanting to stay at grimmauld place   spinners end is located in the town of cokeworth and it s actually where harry stayed at the hotel when vernon was trying to escape the letters from hagrid in ps  we would later learn that spinners end is near the street where lily and petunia grew up  voldemort does seem to make a big mistake here in punishing draco for the mistakes of lucius he misjudges the malfoy family they seem to have very little loyalty to him they see him as a sure bet their work for him is all in their own self interest but the minute when it is nt in their self interest to support him  they disobey narcissa here was nt supposed to talk about draco s mission to snape but she does it to protect her son and i kinda feel like voldemort should understand this it s a very slytherin trait to protect yourself first   does bella really think that snape is on dumbledore s side  or does this opinion stem from her jealousy of his position in the eyes of the dark lord   snape is able to hide his emotions so well but do you think if voldemort or bellatrix brought up lily  would he be able to conceal his emotions about that  would he betray himself   are snape s parents alive  what happened to them   do you think snape s attitude toward muggles has matured  because i m just assuming here that a lot of his dislike for them came from his hatred of his father but that seems like something you can mature out of as an adult  you can rationalise that muggles and wizards are equally capable of the abuse and neglect that snape was subject to has snape rationalised that within himself  or does a lot of that turn around stem from lily  he did nt seem to understand then that she was muggle born and would be offended by his attitude towards them does he understand that now as an adult   where does the hidden staircase in snape s house lead to  was that an original part of the house   snape being able to boss around wormtail must ve been so fantastic for snape yeah he s not james or sirius but he s one of the next best options and also partially responsible for the death of lily he has to love bullying him   would nt wormtail be much more effective at spying on snape if he was in his animagus form   it s mentioned a couple of times that snape s attitude towards bellatrix is mocking he is amused by her and it kinda makes me think that snape almost enjoys his role as double agent he likes to be important he likes the mystery of it and he enjoys being the smartest one in the room i think that last one is important he would nt mock voldemort would he  but he enjoys hiding the truth from someone he considers lesser like bellatrix   do you think wormtail was put here by voldemort to spy on severus   i know most people seem to love alan rickman s portrayal of snape but one of the gripes i would have with it is that rickman s snape does nt say much he picks and chooses his words very carefully but the book snape is much more verbose   snape catches bella out here she must either admit that he is on her side or admit that snape has tricked voldemort it s a loselose for her   snape says that voldemort ordered him to be at hogwarts to spy on dumbledore was that voldemort s idea  or was it somehow engineered by dumbledore to give dumbledore and snape and excuse to meet  because it would suspicious for both to meet otherwise but makes perfect sense if they both are at hogwarts   does snape know the real reason why he is denied the dada job  i presume it s because it s because of the curse on the job more than dumbledore thinking it would bring about a relapse   snape says he had 16 years of information to give voldemort about dumbledore what information did he give  and how does he hide the vital stuff  does he consult dumbledore on what he can say and what he can not   if voldemort had revealed himself to snape in ps  what changes  how does snape change his actions to bring down voldemort whilst not appearing to do so   snape here confirms that he was the one that voldemort referred to when he said that one of their number had left them forever   voldemort seems to cultivate this competition between his death eaters to curry his favour which seems to have both positive and negative consequences i think a negative one is on display here in that it causes jealousy and infighting between death eaters   bella says  the dark lord has  in the past  entrusted me with his most precious  and cuts herself off is she referring here to the horcrux hidden in her vault   jo has said before that when a secret keeper dies  that all the people that the person told the secret to <URL> secret keepers themselves so when dumbledore died  should nt snape have been able to reveal the hq of the order to the death eaters  how did snape explain that away   snape says that his information led to the death of emmeline vance so did dumbledore sacrifice her  did he tell snape to pass along the information that led to her death  why did he pick her  is snape here lying to bella  maybe he s claiming credit for it when it really had nothing to do with him   snape is in his element here when he s insulting harry and i think this is one of the main reasons why voldemort trusts him he s so sincere with his dislike of harry he s not putting on any pretence at all   snape talks about dumbledore s greatest weakness that he has to see the best in people now we later learn that dumbledore has a much stronger reason to trust snape than just believing the best of him now to me  this is a good lie because it s got a fair bit of truth in it but it s also something that dumbledore himself is able to manipulate to get the best out of the lie he can use the idea that voldemort thinks his greatest weakness is his overly trusting nature to misdirect voldemort to make him think dumbledore is making one move when he is actually making another   how much did the duel with voldemort take out of dumbledore  did it affect him at all  or was snape lying here   what does snape tell voldemort about dumbledore s injury  how does he tell him how it was sustained   is narcissa a death eater  she was nt at the graveyard when voldemort returned so is she kind ve an associate  an honorary death eater   why is bella and cissy surprised to find out that snape knows of the plan to kill dumbledore  would nt it make perfect sense  otherwise snape could unwittingly get in the way of the plan like what happened in ps  does snape actually know the plan here  or is he just pretending to know to try and gain information about it  he never says what the plan is before narcissa kinda makes it obvious    if draco succeeds he will be honoured beyond all others   draco kinda achieved his goal he only really failed at the final hurdle but the end result was the same anyway so did he get the proper credit from voldemort for it  lucius still seems to be in the bad books of voldemort in the next book so it would seem not   narcissa calls snape the dark lords favourite is she just sucking up to him  or does voldemort favour snape most  and why is snape voldemort s favourite  does voldemort see himself in snape   dumbledore is nt the type to kill an enemy like narcissa is thinking will happen even his most famous victory ended with him capturing his opponent and i think maybe she expects dumbledore to behave like voldemort would in a similar situation voldemort would show no mercy if he discovered a plot to kill him dumbledore just tries to look out for his would be killer   snape says that in the unlikely event that draco succeeds at the task that snape was to remain a spy a little while longer but when dumbledore actually dies  there s pretty much no need for a spy the order crumbles without dumbledore they have no leadership and they have no initiative it s almost not worth spying on anymore   bella talks about if she had sons do you think if she had sons that being a mother would change her  we see here that narcissa cares more about her son than the dark lord would bella follow the same route  or would she be utterly psychotic   we get our first ever mention of the unbreakable vow i m kinda surprised that voldemort would nt make his supporters make the unbreakable vow to be loyal to him maybe he thinks it s unnecessary   what happens with an unbreakable vow if there s some grey area involved  not all cases are black and white   in court  they should make witnesses swear the unbreakable vow to tell the truth during the court proceedings yeah it would be a little barbaric but you d get the truth out of people   i really think snape could ve gotten out of making the unbreakable vow if he d tried a little harder he could ve said that his vows to voldemort would supersede his obligation to draco if conflict arose and therefore he could nt make the vow as it happens  his vow coincides with dumbledore s plan anyway so no harm was really done   the unbreakable vow was the subject of much speculation did he just kill dumbledore to fulfil the vow  some speculated that snape was on neither side he was just out for himself it was a huge gamble though from snape he called bella s bluff which had to earn him points    quotable quote   well wormtail s here but we re not counting vermin are we 
82,harrypotter,gt  i really think snape could ve gotten out of making the unbreakable vow if he d tried a little harder he could ve said that his vows to voldemort would supersede his obligation to draco if conflict arose and therefore he could nt make the vow as it happens  his vow coincides with dumbledore s plan anyway so no harm was really done  i thought that dumbledore knew of the plan  which is why he made snape promise to be the one to kill him snape made the unbreakable vow because he knew it was already the plan 
83,harrypotter,gt  jo has said before that when a secret keeper dies  that all the people that the person told the secret to <URL> secret keepers themselves so when dumbledore died  should nt snape have been able to reveal the hq of the order to the death eaters  how did snape explain that away  i think snape probably revealed it  but he would have convinced them that no one would use the hq for anything now that dumbledore died and he revealed his  true  allegiance surely they would nt think there s anything worth looking for in the hq since snape has been feeding them information all along anyway not sure if it would be necessary or worth for them to check it out even if he revealed the location it was probably more worth it to target places that actually have order members they want to go after  like the burrow  
84,harrypotter,all for under  7
85,harrypotter, link to previous chapter     <URL>    synopsis   we meet the muggle prime minister he s thinking about all the recent tragedies that have happened a person in a painting coughs and announces the arrival of fudge they discuss recent events the muggle prime minister reminisces about previous meetings with fudge fudge then reveals to the prime minister that voldemort is back they talk about sirius black  the bridge collapse  the giant attack in the west country  amelia bones  emmeline vance and the dementors he then reveals that he has been outed as minister of magic he introduces his successor  rufus scrimguer he talks about security for the prime minister  kingsley and the junior minister who is quacking    poi    jo considered including this chapter in chamber of secrets but it ended up being cut and put here   if we were to apply this to the real world  the most likely candidate for who the muggle prime minister is sir john major who was prime minister of the uk from 1990 to 1997 although that does nt really fit with what fudge says about the previous prime minister he refers to him as a male but the prime minister who preceded sir john was margaret thatcher   there s a talk of a bridge collapse here and in the movies they collapse the millennium bridge however  that bridge opened on june 2000 which was after the events of the main narrative of the harry potter novels the bridge that collapsed in the novel is the brockdale bridge   the opposition leader talks about a grim mood gripping the country fudge confirms this later in this chapter that it is caused by the dementors so is there job just to walk around spreading misery for voldemort  why do nt they kiss more muggles  particularly since they ca nt see them   the opposition leader is described as barely concealing his glee about the recent atrocities and it kinda reminded me why i hate politics   the painting that connects the ministry of magic and the muggle prime minister who is that  was it a real person  did that person hold high offices in both the muggle and wizarding world  does that painting person just have to stay as still as possible most of the day   how would they be able to make the president of the other country forget to call  would nt they have to cast the spell on him directly  do the other ministries of magic from around the world collude to organise meetings for each other   is there a code of ethics for casting spells on muggle leaders  are there certain things you ca nt do   i think wizards really do nt understand how arrogant they sound to others it s a constant complaint about them from centaurs to goblins to the prime minister here   do you think former prime ministers in this world get together and discuss what they know of the magical world   when jo originally planned the series  terrorism was nt nearly the issue that it was when this book was published the world events of the time really give the terrorist actions of the death eaters more emotional weight in the mind of the reader than what would have happened otherwise   fudge changes a tea cup into a gerbil violation of the gamp law about food   if you ca nt remove the painting from the wall  why not remove the wall itself  surely it would be possible i know there s likely a permanent sticking charm here but there s ways around that   how did it take an hour to explain the story of voldemort  how much information is the muggle prime minister given here   under what circumstances is the minister of magic obligated to contact the muggle prime minister   it says that they re importing three foreign dragons now would the common welsh green count as a foreign dragon  you d think not right  which kinda suggests that the champions were originally just meant to fight the other three dragons and presumably the welsh green was the ring in when they needed another to fight harry   for the muggle prime minister to find out why these terrible things are happening but not be able to tell anyone about it or do anything about it must be frustrating as hell  if the muggles united together with the wizards  do you think they would be able to take voldemort down    is a man alive if he can not be killed   it s a surprisingly deep philosophical question here from fudge   we find out that amelia bones has been killed her brother and his wife were murdered in the first war what does voldemort have against this family  why target them   we also find out about emmeline vance s murder the only time we met her previously was as a member of the advance guard in ootp  the most obvious analogy we can make with fudge and scrimgeur is neville chamberlain and winston churchill fudge is the weaker option who seemingly let voldemort take a foothold again and scrimgeur is the fighter a wizard who is seen as tough and fit for war   fudge implies here that he wanted to get harry to speak out in his favour just like scrimgeur attempts later but surelywhy would fudge think that harry would just forgive him for all the shit he put him through the last year  no one could forgive that   the quote that i ve selected at the bottom is important jo talks about this a bit how magic is nt the solution to problems you ca nt just wave your wand and make bad things go away magic is nt the magic bullet    quotable quote   the trouble is  the other side can do magic to  prime minister 
86,harrypotter,the painting of the man that was in the prime ministers office was the first wizard prime minister of the wizarding worldit says it in the chapter  i dont have it with me   i think the muggles would be confused and scared of wizards so i do nt know if that was ever a likely scenariobut if it did happen i do nt know if they could even if they unitevoldemort has giantsmagical means of hidingan army of ruthless death eaters and was able to elude capture for decadestechnology at the time was nt as developed to override magic  amelia bones was a powerful witchwe have instances in the story where if voldemort asks them to join and they refuse he wo nt tolerate ithe ca nt have powerful enemies that could fight him  fudge was desperate and weakfudge asked dumbledore to persuade him because he knows that harry might listeneven harry says himself he s dumbledore man through and through  i like your analogies and observations       yay     
87,harrypotter,gt  we find out that amelia bones has been killed her brother and his wife were murdered in the first war what does voldemort have against this family  why target them  she did nt seem to be on dumbledore s side  in particular  when we saw her at harry s hearing  but i would imagine that a fair minded woman high up in the ministry would be a bit of a hindrance to voldemort in his rise to power once she saw evidence of his return  surely she would nt support him and anyone that was against him was pretty much dead  gt  the opposition leader talks about a grim mood gripping the country fudge confirms this later in this chapter that it is caused by the dementors so is there job just to walk around spreading misery for voldemort  why do nt they kiss more muggles  particularly since they ca nt see them  i do nt think its their job to walk around the country willynilly  but i took it to mean that the huge amount of them pretty much invading really made a difference even if they were just secluded to certain pockets  their numbers would probably have a noticeable effect  especially since there normally are nt any dementors outside of azkaban  gt  do you think former prime ministers in this world get together and discuss what they know of the magical world  i was thinking they would be obliviated once they leave office after all  it s not like everyone in politics knows about wizards  it s just them so at the very end of term  maybe on their last day  or maybe there is something like a passing of the torch where the outgoing prime minister introduces the <URL> prime minister to the minister of magic and then right after that meeting   obliviate  
88,harrypotter,read the books i am not even close to bullshitting you when i say they are so  so  so much better than the films there s a fuck ton of content that was left out of the movies for a lot of mundane filler  you ll be doing yourself a favour  
89,harrypotter,i hope this also prompts you to try not to judge things before you ve readseen them  you could be missing out on awesome stuff 
90,harrypotter,and you watched the movies  lame 
91,harrypotter,ucurious_rampage s recent post about moody seeing one made me think so show or tell  what would a boggart in its natural state look like  i think it d be fun to see what everyone has pictured in their head while reading about them 
92,harrypotter,i have no idea what is going on here these were posted outside a local small theater no other information was posted 
93,harrypotter,gt  dumbledore is nt the type to kill an enemy like narcissa is thinking will happen even his most famous victory ended with him capturing his opponent and i think maybe she expects dumbledore to behave like voldemort would in a similar situation voldemort would show no mercy if he discovered a plot to kill him dumbledore just tries to look out for his would be killer  i think she was a lot more worried about what voldemort would do if he was unsuccessful  not how dumbledore would retaliate also  perhaps just looking out for his innocence seeing him as her little boy and not wanting to have death on his hands so early on in life 
94,harrypotter,gt  gt  the painting that connects the ministry of magic and the muggle prime minister who is that  was it a real person  did that person hold high offices in both the muggle and wizarding world  does that painting person just have to stay as still as possible most of the day  ulick gamp  first minister for magic 
95,harrypotter,<URL> to the fandom 
96,harrypotter,this is one of my favourite chapters in the whole series
97,harrypotter,i m such a fan of harry also  swoon 
98,harrypotter,rip fox
99,harrypotter,have you read the books  oh man  you guys should definitely read the books together  that would no doubt be a very wonderful experience 
100,harrypotter,i always imagined it to look like the magic pudding except bigger with a jabba the hut like body supported with withered froglike legs the eyes would be large yellow saucers it would look creepy yet facinatingly ugly at the same time 
101,harrypotter,it s cultural 
102,harrypotter,a lot was changed for the movies  doing many of the characters a great disservice i strongly suggest you read the books  too 
103,harrypotter,<URL> to the culi mean  the club   d
104,harrypotter,i would say  1  peter pettigrew in gryffindor  peter was the least gryffindor person ever he s basically the biggest coward in the series i do nt know what house he could belong to  but definitely not gryffindor  2  percy weasly in gryffindor percy was a very ambitious person and i think he could belong in slytherin  3  dumbledore in gryffindor  of course dumbledore is a brave man  but i think ravenclaw or slytherin would suit him more yes  slytherin  think about how cunning and manipulative dumbledore could be even if he did nt look like it dumbledore basically lies to everyone in the series and tries to manipulate everyone from harry to snape to voldemort of course it was all for a good cause  but cunning is still cunning and slytherins are not all evil after all also  dumbledore was quite ambitious in his youth with this whole gryndelvald deal  or however his name is spelled  
105,harrypotter,those are nt mariachi hats though
106,harrypotter,gryffindor he s pretty straightforward with everything  and it  was  brave of him to defend harry in front of his parents 
107,harrypotter,i think based on the type of person he looked up to  his mother and father  he would most likely be slytherin
108,harrypotter,probably gryffindor
109,harrypotter,lol 
110,harrypotter,gt  fudge changes a tea cup into a gerbil violation of the gamp law about food  how so  there are multiple instances in the series where they transfigure an inanimate object into an animal  such as when cedric transfigures a rock into a dog when fighting his dragon in gof   by your logic that should impossible  as a violation of the gamp law too i think somehow  magic  is able to tell the difference between food and living animals  gt  if you ca nt remove the painting from the wall  why not remove the wall itself  surely it would be possible i know there s likely a permanent sticking charm here but there s ways around that  yeah  but it would be fairly obvious if the prime minister started trying to remove the wall people in his office would ask him what he was doing  and when he refused answer  they would definitely think he was going crazy even if he called in a professional construction crew to remove wall  they would still expect to be paid the prime minister is going to have a difficult time explaining why he s spending the taxpayers  money on renovating a building that has no structural issues  gt  fudge implies here that he wanted to get harry to speak out in his favour just like scrimgeur attempts later but surelywhy would fudge think that harry would just forgive him for all the shit he put him through the last year  no one could forgive that  i do nt think fudge cared whether or not harry  forgave  him  i think he assumed that he could bribe harry with the promise of political benefits  such as offering him a fasttrack into <URL> an auror   but was ultimately disappointed to learn that harry was not for sale  as he was  dumbledore s man through and through 
111,harrypotter,one of us  one of us  one of us  one of us 
112,harrypotter,who is the strongest wizardwitch of all time  measuring by mere power 
113,harrypotter,he s not allowed the movies just thought it d look cool so they ignored the rules harry does nt cast the spell in the book 
114,harrypotter,hilarious 
115,harrypotter,genius jvl 
116,harrypotter,its hard to tell as there is no versus comparison between most potential title holders due to vastly different time periods you also have to look at given lore and judge how impartial it is for example  most books say harry beats voldemort  which makes him more powerful and yet its obviously not true by the same token  the deatheaters all claim that voldemort was the most powerful wizard ever  yet the order claim dumbledore to be such  going back further  you have the founders  merlin and morgana la fey  let alone all the roman  greek and older contenders for the title  personally  from what i ve read of the hp books  i d wager on it being merlin  everybody uses his name like us muggles swear on god  after all 
117,harrypotter,i ve wondered this before  too in hbp  slughorn and dumbledore do some kind of magic to repair all of the items in the muggle house that slughorn destroyed in an attempt to hide not sure how many of the items are slughorn s and how many are the muggles   and maybe none of them are electronic  but they seem to put them all back together again with no problems  maybe it has to do with the relative skill of the witchwizard and their knowledge of the broken items 
118,harrypotter,book wise  he ca nt  movie wise  however  i d like to think that perhaps <URL> third years were given an assignment by flitwick to practice that particular spell or something  and thus the ministry would be notified beforehand 
119,harrypotter,she was the one possessed by the diary  so she kinda took herself into the chamber  as for why lucius malfoy targeted her  it mentions in the book that arthur weasley was trying to make a law increasing punishment for muggle baiters  which would protect muggles  do nt have the book on me  so sorry i ca nt give you an exact quote  dumbledore mentions it after ginny s rescue   lucius was hoping to sabotage arthur s credibility so the law would nt pass 
120,harrypotter,she is considered a blood traitor  but i think voldy just wanted to come back to life as soon as possible  remember that he was trying to open the chamber and come back to life by draining ginny of it muggleborns were the ones being attacked 
121,harrypotter,it really was nt about ginny she was a means to an end she kept writing in the journal how much she likedloved harry potter riddle was obviously interested in who this harry character was when he learns that harry potter caused the real voldemort to fall from power he used ginny to lure harry to the chamber of secrets  lucius gave ginny the diary specifically because he knew she would eventually be blamed for the murder  attempts  of multiple muggleborn studenst this  in turn  would slander arthur weasley s name 
122,harrypotter,is it because he s hiding it and it s not really  magic   muggles would just think it s a torch  
123,harrypotter,i see it as more of a flashlight than a spell at that point
124,harrypotter,maybe  i hope so  it would it would be very useful
125,harrypotter,i think that s part of the role of head of house it s never explicitly stated  but it seems like they re the person to go to if a student has a problem 
126,harrypotter,supposedly  magic and technology do nt exactly get along but would a fixing spell work on electronics

130,harrypotter,reparo seems to fix physical damage so maybe but it may be difficult  this wire with this wire and that here and this here  as even a millimeter mistake means it wo nt work so something like an old radio will be ok  a new cell phone will be far more difficult i wonder if the wizard has to know the object to repair it 
131,harrypotter,this is absolutely lovely  do you know where it came from 
132,harrypotter,i thought it was muggleborns that were the target  is it simply because she had the diary  or did voldemort need a pureblood to restore himself 
133,harrypotter,that is so beautiful  i especially like the lettering lovely work 
134,harrypotter,on wow its beautiful who made it 
135,harrypotter,where did you get them  want 
136,harrypotter,these are absolutely gorgeous  i definitely need something like this for my potter wall  all i have up there at the moment is a handpainted map of the hogwarts grounds  will post that later    well done  
137,harrypotter,i need these in my life they are absolutely gorgeous and like many others  gave me goosebumps 
138,harrypotter,so it s basically rhp quidditch but for everyone  let the stalking commence 
139,harrypotter,yea  that s a resurrection stone 
140,harrypotter,ordering myself one right meow    edit  i created a new account and it automatically offered me 15  off  woohoo  ca nt wait for it to get here  
141,harrypotter,it s beautiful  congrats on the fun accessory       <URL>  v  dqw4w9wgxcq  i love that it is delicate and understated  it just makes it so alluring to look at 
142,harrypotter,mind  blown  such a small detail for a small thing that winds up being the catalyst to a huge part of harry s life way cool 
143,harrypotter,that article was awesome
144,harrypotter,i do nt know why it took me this long to notice this  but the name  hermione  is a derivative from hermes  but not necessarily from hermes the greek messenger god of trickery  trade  theft  heroes  and of course communication  hermes was merged with mercury by the romans   for the greeks had other gods named hermes  hermione s name fits all too well with the syncretic god hermes trismegastis  hermes trismegastis  famed deity for which the hermaneutic method is named  is thought by many scholars to be a syncretic divinity combining the greek god hermes with the egyptian god thoth the ancient greeks had noticed that both gods were gods of magic and scribes  and other forms of written communication   ie bookish they both were psychopomps  divine figures who escort others to the afterlife or the underworld hermes trismegastis combined within him hermes  godhood over communication and heroism and thoth s godhood over astrology  alchemy  and wisdom  it seems fitting that hermione could be named after the syncretic god of scribes  magic  heroism  and wisdom  on the other hand  although jk is known for her clever naming of characters in the harry potter stories  this could also be simply a pleasant convenience  i ve googled about this and found nothing to tell me one way or the other  does anyone know 
145,harrypotter,i always thought she was named after hermes because she is a messenger for the underrepresented like with spew 
146,harrypotter,missing  apparel  couple of tshirts  a scarf  and a pair of shoes   the book jacket for sorcerer s stone  ruined in a move and need to find a new one   and deathly hallows pt 2 dvd because my boss borrowed it 
147,harrypotter,your movies are out of order  p
148,harrypotter,what s that framed print in the back  where can i buy it 
149,harrypotter,i am trying to imagine what severus snape as a headmaster s portrait could do he s relatively young compared to descriptions of the other past headmasters  so i ca nt imagine him taking lots of naps maybe place another portrait of him in the potions room so he can continue teachinglike the history of magic professor who was a ghost  and this gets me on to the subject of these portraits in general and the rules for what the headmasters can and ca nt do in deathly hallows  snape talked to dumbledore s portrait and dumbledore had full knowledge still of everything going down with he shall not be named and the horcruxes  and that snape will notice a time when v <URL> more protective of nagini soit appears his faculties are still fully functioning  questions   can headmaster portraits visit other paintings in hogwarts as we ve seen with the knight and fat lady   do headmasters retain full magical knowledge  so for example  had snape gotten new information and shared it with dumbledore  could d have thought about this and instructed snape on what to do  or are the portraits merely messengers or contained to only their previous thoughts 
150,harrypotter,the information over at the harry potter wikia  take it as you will  for  portraits     <URL>  and  headmaster portraits     <URL>  indicates that the subject of the portrait does nt maintain much  if any  memory of his or her life for this reason headmaster portraits tend to be created early on in the headmaster s career and then sit in a cupboard so the painting can learn and retain all of the information the headmaster does  since snape s portrait was nt added  or even made  i m assuming  until after his death  i do nt think it would be a very good representation of snape and it would nt have the knowledge necessary to teach a class unless you taught the portrait potionsbut why would you do that when you could hire real live me to teach potions 
151,harrypotter,wow  really cool  nice work 
152,harrypotter,the only horcruxes we know about were tom s  but he made some interesting choicesmistskes nagini and harry are living things  would they have lived forever had part of tom s soul never been destroyed  these two horcruxes raise more questions do horcruxes have to be solid  what about liquid  a plasma or a gas  do they have to matter at all  what about an electromagnetic field  or a photon  is there a size limit  could the moon be a horcrux  or the indian ocean  of course this is all purely academic 
153,harrypotter,mind  blown  such a small detail for a small thing that winds up being the catalyst to a huge part of harry s life way cool 
154,harrypotter,  <URL> here s mine  d not original at all and nothing really amazing about it but i love it and i have a story to tell to everyone who asks  btw if you get one be prepared to tell a lot of people that it s a harry potter tat cuz a lot of people are gon na ask 
155,harrypotter,i m heavily considering getting a hp tattoo and i ve looked at a lot of images which ones are your favorites that you ve seen out there 
156,harrypotter,this is my favorite thing in our living room    <URL>
157,harrypotter,i feel like i m the only one who caught that the first time i watched it gt  gt  it was just obvious to me  edit  oh i m sorry for being an observant child  i was nt trying to be dick  but thanks for the downvotes an observation was made  and i noticed it before  whoop dee do apparently  people need their puny egos coddled for failing to make an obvious observation 
158,harrypotter,consider every wizard that died in the series consider how many dead wizards had valuable information that could have helped those fighting against death eaters and voldemort himself had just a handful of the dead chosen to remain in the living world  imagine how much quicker voldemort could have been defeated  yes it would have cost them their afterlives but some of the dead must have been gryffindors selfless heroism even beyond death anyone 
159,harrypotter,people die in this tournament  is a great title for the askaban movie if it was clickbait 
160,harrypotter,i m not sure if you  choose  to <URL> a ghost the natural inclination is to move on  but ghosts are formed through intense fear or trauma  i know nick talks about this process in the seventh    book  but i do nt have my books for reference right now 
161,harrypotter,i love how you have them arranged  i have the theatrical size deathly hallows print  its gorgeous i love his style  i wish we had the wall space for all of them 
162,harrypotter,i m heavily considering getting a hp tattoo and i ve looked at a lot of images which ones are your favorites that you ve seen out there 
163,harrypotter,in the book it s the password to get in as he s sleeping in the corridor when harry and the others go for the midnight duel 
164,harrypotter,would you like me to  sign     <URL>  them for you 
165,harrypotter, that s     <URL>   so     <URL>   cool     <URL>

172,harrypotter,wow those look really sweet    but i bet you re just as sweet too  haha just kidding    i just like to give people compliments because it makes them happy  i hope you re having a good valentines day   
173,harrypotter,i have nt tried any yet  i ll probably get a sampler of each  
174,harrypotter,i would have loved this as a valentine s day gift  but there is always my birthday  or you know any other day is a great reason for a gift  
175,harrypotter,oh my there are all sorts of fandom teas brb trying them all 
176,harrypotter,i ordered harry potter themed teas through a seller here too  not this particular seller though  it was  this one     <URL>  userid  327324ar   really fantastic customer service  and the teas all smelled amazing  they were a gift so i cant attest to tasteand im not much of a tea person as it is  p  
177,harrypotter,well no  because the others would realise and tell him  especially hermione   it has to be something less obvious 
178,harrypotter,i am trying to imagine what severus snape as a headmaster s portrait could do he s relatively young compared to descriptions of the other past headmasters  so i ca nt imagine him taking lots of naps maybe place another portrait of him in the potions room so he can continue teachinglike the history of magic professor who was a ghost  and this gets me on to the subject of these portraits in general and the rules for what the headmasters can and ca nt do in deathly hallows  snape talked to dumbledore s portrait and dumbledore had full knowledge still of everything going down with he shall not be named and the horcruxes  and that snape will notice a time when v <URL> more protective of nagini soit appears his faculties are still fully functioning  questions   can headmaster portraits visit other paintings in hogwarts as we ve seen with the knight and fat lady   do headmasters retain full magical knowledge  so for example  had snape gotten new information and shared it with dumbledore  could d have thought about this and instructed snape on what to do  or are the portraits merely messengers or contained to only their previous thoughts

180,harrypotter,this is the most logical thing i ve seen from his tweets 
181,harrypotter,these are great    10 sweet points to upicklesmcgeezac   
182,harrypotter,i do nt know if this is okay  but i wanted to tell everyone because i know people here can understand the feeling of losing harry potter books  when i was living in my apartment with my boyfriend  i had all of my books at my mom s since we did nt have a ton of extra room when my mom sold her house  i packed up all my books and put them in my aunt s attic now  my aunt is nt the best judge of character and lets random people  friends of friends  live with her  she called me just yesterday and informed me that she went in the attic and saw that those people  who she kicked out in january  had ransacked all of my boxes when i went today  i could nt find my harry potter books  my childhood book collection or the over  400 worth of books that i had gotten for my classroom  all of my harry potter books had different things written in the front cover  who bought it for me  where i bought it  when i got it  when i finished reading it when i realized they were gone  i started bawling my eyes out those books are what i  and most of you  grew up on that was my first series to read it has continued to be such a huge part of my life and it s justgone  again  i m sorry if this is nt an appropriate post i wanted to tell people who could truly understand what it would be like to lose these books 
183,harrypotter,you do not f0ck with a person s books i will hex them so hard that their  ghosts  will feel it if you find the sleeze that did this absolutely appalling  i m so sorry  both my dear cousin and my best friend gave me their childhood bookshelves  they are my most precious possessions i ca nt imagine how i would feel if they were destroyed or stolen 
184,harrypotter,oh my i m so sorry i would be absolutely devastated i am having empathy pains from the far reaches of the internet for you and sending you a hug and a half is there a way for us redditors to help you maybe rebuild your collection  it would nt be the same  but i know i would be happy to help in any way  
185,harrypotter,aww i m sorry maybe you can replace them 
186,harrypotter,are you in the us  i have a hardcover chamber of secrets collector edition  scholastic leather bound collector s edition  you can have if you d like i am ocd and they did nt print the remaining books in the same collection  so i ll never have a matching set 
187,harrypotter,oh no  i have an extra deathly hallows because i moved to seattle from the east coast and i did nt bring my books with me would you like my extra copy  it s hardback   i d be happy to send it out later this week it s in less than perfect shape because i bought it at a second hand store  but i m currently back at my parents  for a brief stay and i can just take my original book back with me please let me know and i m sorry that you had things stolen from you i ca nt even imagine the feeling  
188,harrypotter,these are amazing you re dumbledorable

196,harrypotter,this is the oc we deserve good work out there 
197,harrypotter,i hope said person has sneak across their face in acne by now    that is truly devastating and not the material loss  
198,harrypotter,read this article today  wondering what you guys think some decent points were made    <URL>
199,harrypotter,umbridge  snape  tom riddle were halfbloods  half blood price  and were slytherin 
200,harrypotter,fuck this guy hufflepuffs are awesome 
201,harrypotter,i truly think some of dumbledore s decisions were very questionable  specifically    1  huge favoritism towards gryffindor   a  the huge fuck you slytherin in the first book where he basically awards some last minute points to gryffindor  even though the slytherin kids were sure to win he even had to do it during the ceremony to give the poor slytherins hope they would win and then humiliate them no wonder the slytherins hate him  b  sirius tried to murder snape  nope  lets not expel the guy who by the way did nt even stop bullying snape after basically trying to kill him snape was a slytherin so i guess dumbledore did nt care  c  slytherin s head is a dick and a horrible teacher  snape   nope lets keep the guy who gives a bad example to his students just because we got ta  keep an eye on him     2  bad decisions with the staff   a  dada teachers keep dying or horrible things happen to them  lets not just cancel the cursed subject  lets keep putting people s lives in danger b  lets hire that useless trealawney because  we got ta keep an eye on her   c  lets hire snape who is a horrible teacher and a bully to his students because  we got ta keep an eye on him    3  his manipulation and lies   when you think about it  dumbledore always lies and tries to manipulate people he lies so much that it s hard to tell when he s honest he did nt tell anyone about his past  which is understandable i guess   he did nt tell harry about the prophesy until it was too late  he did nt tell harry that he was a horcrux and left snape to do the dirty work  he did nt explain shit to harry most of the time and left him to figure out everything himself he tried to manipulate harry  he tried to manipulate snape  he even tried to manipulate slughorn to make him accept the position of course he meant well  but his brother was right when he called him a liar 
202,harrypotter,there are times i wondered if he bought into his own publicity and had developed a because i m dumbledore  things will work out how i need them to in the end  complex the man was brilliant  no doubt  but i do nt think sanity had been his friend from the time his sister died i think having to put his former best friend down probably finished him off  the problem with devoting yourself to the greater good  is that you tend to lose sight of all the lesser good  that you force to be sacrificed along the way and because you do nt see such as unfair  you forget that to other s they can be just as important as your greater good  for dumbledore  i think the phrase the road to hell is paved with good intentions  could very well be appropriate 
203,harrypotter,i d like to address this point by point    1  huge favoritism towards gryffindor   a  you re right  this was a dick move  b  dumbledore had a habit of seeing the best in people a lot of people benefited from his benefit of the doubt  not just gryffindors i m not saying his optimism never caused any trouble i just do nt think this is indicative of favoritism towards gryffindor  c  how does this show favoritism towards gryffindor  snape was a dick  but not the worst professor he was a potions savant the pool of people competent enough to teach this subject does nt seem to be very big it must have seemed like an acceptable price to pay for the children to learn from a real potions master    2  bad decisions with the staff   a  the professors who took the dada position were aware of the curse  at least in the seven years we get to see it is a vital subject  and i daresay more lives would be lost by the children not learning dada than one teacher per year potentially dying  remember  they did nt all die   b  to be fair  she was teaching a useless subject and she did need to be kept around if she was just farting around in a shack on the outskirts of hogsmeade  who would ever know about subsequent predictions she made  c  you used this point already    3  his manipulation and lies   dumbledore is a human being he s put on a pedestal by everyone  but he is just as fallible as anyone else he addresses some of the mistakes you mention here and admits his hubris and his poor judgment i ca nt imagine how i would handle telling a twelve or thirteen or fourteen or even fifteen year old child about their truly morbid fate  so i ca nt judge dumbledore for handling it poorly or putting it off 
204,harrypotter,wow that s awesome   i wan na get one now  is it good quality  i ca nt find a lot of reviews about that vancaro website thanks  
205,harrypotter,i think snape was jealous of james  but not really for the reasons that most people think especially lupin here snape does hate that james is popular   big quidditch hero   but also does nt value athleticism   i d rather be brainy than brawny    he s more madjealous that society values these things over things he values that james and sirius were handed everything in life looks  money  popularity  and his intelligence and hard work despite coming from poverty means nothing 
206,harrypotter,i m going to make a lot of assumptions here so please bare with me  being in the order would bring about a lot of intimate information lupin was nt a person to blab what he knows and frankly who would he have talked to with sirius in prison  after lily s death snape would ve been inconsolable who knows how he reacted  probably withdrawing  and maybe even slipping up in front of members of the order because only they would be showing any emotion about the potters  remus is kind  compassionate  caring  and introspective perhaps these qualities couple with a few scraps of information from dumbledore or another member of the order and the out of character  overreaction  by snape  which by most people s standard would be controlled  but for a fellow introvert these signs could be a bit more obvious  of course if remus knows or caught wind that snape s patronus changed and bang  we get that odd sentence structure in the quote  retread it this time with the knowledge that remus is keeping the information guarded either for harry or even snap s sake it s an odd place to pause and he mentions  thinking  as in hypothesizing and using  anyway  as a throw away to move the subject along without dwelling i believe he s just giving a plausible story with partial truth but he knows the truth and is just being a good person and sparing two people a lot of pain and confusion 
207,harrypotter,a divination chart  the sun in the middle makes me think it s astrology related 
208,harrypotter,coloring it in correctly allows you to summon demons
209,harrypotter,thats the bs3 chart  
210,harrypotter,it s clearly not page threehundred and fortynine ten points from gryffindor 
211,harrypotter,thought i d share this with you guys i own one of several pairs of glasses made for the film  harry potter and the philosopher s stone  i was given these when i was <SMILE> in 2002 by simon murray  the spectacle maker   here s a few photos     <URL>  cool huh 
212,harrypotter,that is cool  thanks for sharing  
213,harrypotter,that s really cool  lucky you  
214,harrypotter,maybe some language courses  like gobbledegook for example 
215,harrypotter,basic healing
216,harrypotter,this is obviously written by someone who dislikes the franchise  and he did nt say it was evil he said it was a jerk  racism  his cause and effect is backwards slytherin is nt for purebloods  purebloods tend to prefer slytherin due to their arrogance  laziness  first off  some people are easier to read than others  but let s really look at the weasley example while a lot of people tend to forget this  the hat looks at values  not traits naturally  a family as tight and loving as the weasleys are going to have the same values taught to them by their parents again  i feel the writer is taking the quick sorting and the hat s quip and reversing which one effected the other also  harry was a great fit for both gryffindor and slytherin considering how much harry did nt want to be in slytherin  it had no reservations putting him into gryffindor on the other hand  it argued with neville for almost five minutes because he wanted to be a hufflepuff as we know  the hat was nt having it and put him where it thought he belonged  invasion of privacy  it s a psychic hat what are you going to do  also  the movie s exclamation about harry s feelings towards slytherin is inadmissible  seeing as the movies are terrible  closing  it was nt the hat s fault the school was segregated it was enchanted to sort things because four other wizards wanted it that way  tl  dr  sorting hat 4 lyf
217,harrypotter,that white line at the end must be the kings cross scene with dumbledore 
218,harrypotter,this article is lazy and poorly informed which is unfortunate because there is a lot to criticize about the sorting  but this article takes the lazy approach of attacking the instrument rather than the institution 
219,harrypotter,does brewing a magical potion requires any magical skill  or it is enough to put right ingredences to cauldron in the right order and follow the recipe  would it be possible to mugglesquib to brew  for example  felix felicis or polyjuice potion 
220,harrypotter,found an answer straight from pottermore for you   gt  gt  it is often asked whether a muggle could create a magic potion  given a potions book and the right ingredients the answer  unfortunately  is no there is always some element of wandwork necessary to make a potion  merely adding dead flies and asphodel to a pot hanging over a fire will give you nothing but nastytasting  not to mention poisonous  soup  
221,harrypotter,this is the most logical thing i ve seen from his tweets 
222,harrypotter,this is the oc we deserve good work out there 
223,harrypotter,i ve always wondered this critically  it did nt seem to be as well received as the other books and apart from a couple of the camping chapters  i m not really sure why could someone who did nt think the book was satisfactory elaborate as to why it disappointed 
224,harrypotter,it was disappointing to me for three reasons  1 most of my favorite characters died  2 an awful lot of the book felt disjointed and aimless to me  including the wandering around in the woods for weeks  3 this may be an unpopular opinion  but it s always bothered me that harry did nt actually die i felt like the whole whoops jk not dead  thing was a copout  and it cheapened the story for me i felt like that was the natural point to which the story was building 
225,harrypotter,gt  credence  played by ezra miller  is apparently a character that <URL> notable in the harry potter universe  we do nt know he s part of potter canon yet we only know that he will be in the end since he s from the us  we ve probably never heard of him again 
226,harrypotter,my guess is he writes one of the textbooks he is nt personally significant in harry s story  but he <URL> known throughout the wizarding world 
227,harrypotter,we do nt know if hogwarts prey on creature fearswe only see hogwarts transform when there are humans the same rules might not apply 
228,harrypotter,what country and continent do you think it will be located  is there any information regarding ilvermony s location per jkr 
229,harrypotter,why does this sub in particular enjoy posting extra jpeged screenshots of tumblr reposts  if it s just text link to the actual post or copy and paste it if it s an image drag and drop it into imgur
230,harrypotter,i have nt tried any yet  i ll probably get a sampler of each  
231,harrypotter,i would have loved this as a valentine s day gift  but there is always my birthday  or you know any other day is a great reason for a gift  
232,harrypotter,oh my there are all sorts of fandom teas brb trying them all 
233,harrypotter,i am gon na order a sample box 
234,harrypotter,i ordered harry potter themed teas through a seller here too  not this particular seller though  it was  this one     <URL>  userid  327324ar   really fantastic customer service  and the teas all smelled amazing  they were a gift so i cant attest to tasteand im not much of a tea person as it is  p  
235,harrypotter, that s     <URL>   so     <URL>   cool     <URL> 
236,harrypotter,last october my girlfriend and i purchased tickets to see the cursed child in london on august 11 and 12 unfortunately  something recently came up with my girlfriend  s work and there  s no way we  ll be able to get to london at that time  i was wondering if there is any sort of ticket exchange or some other way we could possibly swap our tickets with someone who has tickets to a later showing any help would be greatly appreciated as we still really want to see the play in london thanks 
237,harrypotter,wizards returning as ghosts comprise several plot points in the septimus heap series  most notably  you can call on a meeting of all former wizard leaders to draw upon their collective ghostly advice of course  whether or not it is relevant or useful is up for debate 
238,harrypotter,needs more jpeg   s
239,harrypotter,portus
240,harrypotter,i dont follow haha
241,harrypotter,1  iirc  jkr was a classics major she knows this  2  i think  given her extensive study of the classics   this     enwikipediaorgwikihermione_   mythology    is as likely a source  although less cool 3  to be completely fair  i think the original mythological figure in 2 was also likely named after hermes  in one aspect or another   so i still think this is pretty awesome
242,harrypotter,i got the sense that it has to be an object  in the traditional sense the very nature of its purpose suggests that it should be able to be hidden it seems to need to be solid it definitely needs to be comprised of physical matter  otherwise how could you contain your soul within it  again  it needs to be a traditional object i have no idea about the moon  you d have to get there  as well as be able to perform the ritual to make it a horcrux  which might be difficult  but who knows  the ocean  almost certainly not liquids do nt seem like they could be made into horcruxes too much flux 
243,harrypotter,me too 
244,harrypotter,in the third book lupin describes the boggart and since it takes the form of whatever the person in front of it fears most no one knows what it looks like when it is alone then in the fifth book there is the boggart in the upstairs room of number 12 and molly asks moody to look at it since the boggart ca nt see moody it must have been in its regular form i wonder what it looks like 
245,harrypotter,for some reason i always imagine them like  this     cdnbulbagardennetuploadthumb662093haunterpng250px093haunterpng  
246,harrypotter,i have a theory  it is invisible in its neutral form kinda like a ghost as portrayed in modern times  where it s invisible but can move things and stuff like that if that s the case  then moody did nt even notice it 
247,harrypotter,personally  i imagine it as a bluesilver sphere however  the reason that s the case is that i did nt realize what happened when it turned into a moon in front of lupin  and even though i now know that s wrong  it stuck 
248,harrypotter,these are seriously adorable  you have a lot of talent 
249,harrypotter,adorable can i ask for the recipe   i ve been wanting to try to make some of these for ages but have nt found a good one yet 
250,harrypotter,that s super cool  thanks for sharing 
251,harrypotter,the internet has won i need nothing else today 
252,harrypotter,since it sounds like they were stolen just in january  i suppose theres a chance they might be listed on craigslist or even ebay  i would take a look there  maybe you ll get lucky and can track them down  i ca nt imagine they would steal them simply for their own collection 
253,harrypotter,english maths physical education  playing sports 
254,harrypotter,i study ancient runes in my spare time most of the symbols in the border are runes 
255,harrypotter,the small symbols on the outside border are the symbols of planets  so that hints at astronomy 
256,harrypotter,i ve been relistening to the harry potter series during delivery driving at work and i just finished  the order of the phoenix  again it must have been the most depressing feeling for harry  when he finally opened sirius  present at the end  realizing that he could have communicated with him so much easier and possibly prevented his death with it so sad and i had another reminder how snape could have prevented it all  by actually trying to teach harry occlumency and not giving up 
257,harrypotter,the part where he finds the mirror breaks my heart every time  if only he had opened the present when he d received it i really wish they had included that scene in the movie  especially since the mirror plays such a vital role in book 7   but it probably did nt seem too significant at the time  just a sad detail 
258,harrypotter,wow  that looks fantastic  those colors damn 
259,harrypotter,or summon the objects in the room after the fiendfyre  or summon the room with the fiendfyre gone  the nature of the fiendfyre is magic and presumably while it can destroy magical objects  i m under the impression that one could transfigure ashes of a former object back into itself so that leaves my question  is it possible for the room of requirement to restore all the objects in the room of hidden things  minus any enchantments cast upon the objects  which i presume is nullified after being burned   additional questions   does the room of requirement  being of its own magic  have its own protections which the fiendfyre would nt affect   does the room of requirement  being that it can be multiple rooms  still exist despite the fiendfyre in the version of the room of requirement that is the room of hidden things  also  if the room of requirement still exists  does that mean the room of hidden things just the only thing destroyed   is the nature of the room of requirement an everlasting spell  meaning that as a type of magic and not a object  the fiendfyre would nt be able to destroy it   does the room of requirement have its own magic   why did nt the fiendfyre escape the room of requirement 
260,harrypotter,honestly i was always under the assumption that the ror itself was destroyed with the fiendfyre its really interesting to consider the alternative that  just  the room of hidden things was destroyed 
261,harrypotter,my thoughts are  that magical destruction is final much like avada kedavera once it s goneit s gone  i m not sure what precedent is set for returning magical artifacts from ashes  other than obviously a phoenix  so it really boils down too is the ror more magical than magical destruction  i believe no  however the ror could conjure a fairly detailed replication of the original item if it was wellneeded the original however would be destroyed 
262,harrypotter,i assume no  because the items were destroyed by magic it was nt normal fire  it was magical fire kind of like how george s ear ca nt be healed because it was magically cursed off 
263,harrypotter,the room of requirement ca nt summon any objects from the room of hidden things because its purpose of keeping things hiddenwhen hermione tries to summon the diadem in deathly hallows it didnt work now you could say that maybe  as a headcanon  that voldemort put an enchantment on the tiara so it ca nt be summonedbut that ca nt be true because voldemort did nt think that anyone would know about the room so what was the point  i do nt know what happened to the room of requirement after the fiendfyre ate all the objectsnothing in the books says anything about it afterward also the transfiguration part would require you to know what the object was before it burned to ashes so i do nt think they can as for summoning the objects  requesting the ror  back from the asheswe really do nt know the limits of the room s magic also fiendfyre is very dark magic so i do nt think it s likely the room can bring it back 
264,harrypotter,they both <URL> the funniest jokes in the history of the universe  god damn  we need to try this 
265,harrypotter,tea and butterbeer   my dear  you know it s either  champagne     <URL>  or nothing 
266,harrypotter,  <URL>
267,harrypotter,some variety of bowtruckle 
268,harrypotter,i found a front shot i ca nt seem to match up the pig like snout and teeth   <URL>
269,harrypotter,ot  but it reminds me of a mix of salacious crumb and a gamorrean
270,harrypotter,imperius the minister s secretary  tell himher to steal it
271,harrypotter,a real artificial eye you say  those are opposites  mind you  however  i love your tribute to my mentor  
272,harrypotter,i love that you may homage to the books and have the magical eye on the right  not the left like the movies changed it to  for some reason 
273,harrypotter,hey madeye  i found  this     <URL>  by the rose bushes  do you know what it is 
274,harrypotter,you should be able to get it from gamestop  but   online     not  instore it will not be there if you try to get it in the store  and i do nt know if they can order it for you and have it shipped to you just running a quick search  it looks like it s going for  999 preowned with them  otherwise  on amazon it seems to be  2695 used right now on ebay  the cheapest i saw was a  099 bid  12 hrs left  with  400 shipping 
275,harrypotter,  rita skeeter    she reminded me of someone i know she was the cliche annoying reporter who put her own spin on everything the part that really sealed it was in interview about dumbledore and she said her and harry were in contact  drove me nuts    cho chang    i just found her horribly irritating 
276,harrypotter,justin finchfletchley i m still seething over the whole parseltonguewizard duel scene  malfoy  conjures a snake  it goes for j finch  then and  only then  does harry start speaking parseltongue  and the snake backs off really  he s smart enough to get into eton but he concludes from these events that harry sicced the snake on him  surely muggleborn justin finchfletchley should have no preexisting parselmouthbias i can only conclude that he s a colossal idiot  and that s before you consider his very punchable face in the movies 
277,harrypotter,villians  i really wanted to say  dolores umbridge   but she at least got jailed  while another disgusting person    rita skeeter   was never punished i guess that in britain s magical law there is no such thing as defamation in muggle world skeeter would ve drown in lawsuits   heroes     james potter    of course rich  spoiled brat  basically gryffindor s draco malfoy except everybody loves him because  yknow  rich and handsome 
278,harrypotter,zacharias smith probably he s not the worst person out there but even the bad guys have a bit of the  love to hate them  vibe going on  or they re interesting enough as characters to make me enjoy reading about them smith is just a jackass  honorable mentions to hagrid and dobby 
279,harrypotter,i really hated pettigrew 
280,harrypotter,obviously umbridge  but i ll be honest  harry himself is right up there snape constantly accuses him of every trait that drives me up the wall with him 
281,harrypotter, amazon link to all current listings     <URL>  dp_olp_0  ie  utf<SMILE>amp  condition  all 
282,harrypotter,what a rotten thing for those people to do  i m so sorry  i think all of us here can relate to how important harry potter was when we were growing up books especially can take hold of our hearts and develop a rich tapestry of emotions that we associate with reading them 
283,harrypotter,that s real cruddy like damn 
284,harrypotter,i think this is being a bit to kind  but it may be half true  some things in it are quite nice  i think he disliked of muggle born and had more of a  those lower less real wizards  feeling a lot like we see in the real world in the ww2  just to name one example   this is mostly because people are often racist and classiest when there in such a passion also can you blame him  if he rely was this much of a  good person  i think the others would have known he would explain why he felt the way he felt  but i do like the idea of the chamber being a thing of defense 
285,harrypotter,iveread about this before but it still does nt excuse the fact that he put a basilisk to kill innocent children 
286,harrypotter,ginny she s about as deep as a small puddle 
287,harrypotter,  remus lupin   passiveaggressive  emotionallycowardly jerk he was the only good guy character that truly aggravated me  of the ones basically built for readers to hate    umbridge   was the worst i feel more comfortable when characters run into bellatrix lestrange umbridge is justdiabolical 
288,harrypotter,umbridge reminds me of hillary
289,harrypotter,i am sorry to hear about this  is it possible for you to hunt them down and make them pay or at least get your books back 
290,harrypotter,there are plenty of characters that i love to hate  looking at you umbridge   but i do nt know that there are any characters whose actual existence i hate  i was nt a big fan of cho chang post cedric diggory  but i guess if i had to choose my least favourite harry potter character is that nigel character from the movies why not just use a creevey brother for that role 
291,harrypotter,romilda vane is about the only character in the series whose presence i actively hate 
292,harrypotter,i think there are a few gaps here slytherin wanted to protect wizards and witches apparently  unless they were muggle borns in which case he was apparently happy to leave them at the mercy of the muggles he supposedly feared  i think it s also worth nothing that there is very little to suggest that there was ever any real threat from muggles for most wizardswitches book 3 tells us that even the mass burnings were completely ineffective aside from hufflepuff each of the founders reflected their own prejudices  i do nt think it s a problem with the story that slytherin took it too far and i do nt think retroactive justification with tons of unprovable speculation will make slytherin some misunderstood hero 
293,harrypotter,cho chang partly because she was so pathetic and did nt know how good a thing she had with going out with harry  young me was in love   but as the series moved on and harry became older  i actually really started to dislike him  he was moody  ungrateful  whiney  selfpitying and over dramatic i felt like if i ever met a boy like him in real life i d have no problems telling him to suck it up and shut up there were times he made me want to skip his lines in the book  also  in terms of the movies  i hated all the girls simply on the principle that they were there on set and i was not  p
294,harrypotter,using a basilisk is pretty inefficient if the goal was to purge all the muggleborns the basilisk could easily kill a pureblood by mistake  there is nt any evidence that it cared about blood purity so i think the theory makes some sense 
295,harrypotter,as much as this is a nice theory  it doesnt make sense slytherin was a bigot  the castle is cloaked and unplottable the castle wasnt at risk of being stormed  the best way to protect the magical community as a whole is to educate and hide any magical being  instead of having little timmy get angry and burn a house down because he doesnt know he was born a wizard  that being said  i do agree with the design and purpose of the cos it is just a more extreme form of castle defense than im assuming the other founders were comfortable with  especially with only 1 of them being able to control it 
296,harrypotter,gt  lets hire that useless trealawney because  we got ta keep an eye on her   i do nt think dumbledore had much personal interest in keeping an eye trelawney  i think it was more that she was in as much danger as harry in the absence of being able to protect her as well as harry  he hired her to make sure he could protect her 
297,harrypotter,i got the exact same
298,harrypotter,i ve found quibblo to be quite unreliable
299,harrypotter,if jk rowling had nt given us this new word  how was i supposed to learn that  it sounds racist  is a perfectly legitimate reason to find offense 
300,harrypotter,gt  he did nt tell harry about the prophesy until it was too late i ve always wondered which is worse  that dumbledore told him about the prophecy too late because harry should have been put to work sooner  or that he told him too early because harry was underage 
301,harrypotter,in hbp  it specifies murder  before it uses the word killing  so  i m assuming it would have to be a premeditated killing with malice involved  gt   by an act of evil  the supreme act of evil by committing murder  i guess it can be argued molly committed murder she was defending ginny  but it looked like she fully intended to kill bellatrix from the moment she started fighting there was nt going to be any stunning or knocking her unconscious she was also clearly furious and possibly in revenge mode  still  i think her motives were mostly innocent she wanted to stop bellatrix and perhaps believed death was the only way she d stop these were her last words to bellatrix after all  gt   you  will  never  touch  our  children  again  
302,harrypotter,canon seems to imply that the soul does nt always split through the act of killing we have these two quotes on the subject  gt   well   said slughorn <URL>   you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole splitting it is an act of violation  it is against nature  gt   but how do you do it   gt   by an act of evil  the supreme act of evil by commiting murder killing rips the soul apart the wizard intent upon creating a horcrux would use the damage to his advantage  he would encase the torn portion    gt   and my soul  dumbledore  mine   gt   you alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation   said dumbledore  this seems to imply  to me  that your reasons for killing are what determine whether your soul is torn someone who murders for their own profit  selfishly  risks a torn soul  while someone who kills someone for more selfless reasons  putting someone out of their misery  protecting someone  or for self defence  can come through the whole thing with a whole soul  personally  i do nt think molly s soul is damaged she killed to defend her children  and while she might have hated bellatrix in that moment  i do nt think she enjoyed it she did what was necessary and because she had no other choice in that situation  not out of some sort of joy or to get ahead herself 
303,harrypotter,i always assumed killing was necessary but not sufficient for making horcruxes
304,harrypotter,are the new ebooks in this vein 
305,harrypotter,1000  yes or a published book that just contains all the information would also be okay with me 
306,harrypotter,as the title asks  i d like to know which original motion picture soundtrack you liked most out of all eight films if you have several tracks from one album you d like to elaborate on  feel free  for me  i d have to say harry potter and the halfblood prince is my favorite out of all the soundtracks  this ompst has many tracks that i really enjoy listening to   opening  the best opening theme in my opinion  though it has a real tough competitor  lily s theme   the subtle thuds in the beginning  the hint of hedwig s theme  the violins  the chant  then the intensiveness of the second half   the story begins  i really enjoy the tracks that essentially open up  not the film  but the story  eg another story  ootp    it s truly wonderful at the 1  2<SMILE> mark   living death  as much as this track reminds me of umbridge  there s a mix of several other things i associate this track with luna skipping through the corridors  the da evading the inquisitorial squadfilch  hermione and harry concocting draught of living death overall  this track makes me smile   ron  s victory  i truly love and am fascinated by the sharp  strong  and quick arcos throughout the song the violin work in this track is amazing definitely fits for ron s moment also like the reuse of some elements from quidditch  third year by john williams in prisoner of azkaban   harry amp  hermione  wellca nt say a lot about this track without writing a few paragraphs so i ll keep it simple this track gives off a vibe of hopeless love the harp s delicate strums  the silent violins that crescendo as the harps strums do it also helped that daniel and emma really nailed this scene in the film wish i could say more  but i ll leave this as is   the slug party  the implementation of jazzlike cymbal work is great the track itself is a bit calming and pleasant to the ear hermione trying to avoid cormac in the scene this music was played in was humorous   journey to the cave  right at the beginning you can already feel harry s about to embark on some journey of sorts then the sharp violin arcos and the bass  or cellos  i apologize if i m getting any instruments wrong  begin next  the tempo builds as harry and dumbledore apparate atop a gigantic boulder as the waves are crashing about then the eeriness sets in as the track ends   the drink of despair  wowthis track is immensely emotional the distorted voices  the violins  the feeling they give of endless pain  the huge crescendo near the end   dumbledore s farewell   sigh  whoever listens to this and does nt shed a tear the reuse of chants from opening in a more subtle tone  the violin arcos  the composition of this track is utterly beautiful as the music slowly grows louder  it hits me harder in the feels well done  hooper well done   the friends  along with another year ends  this track incredibly gives off a feeling of moving forward and losing an innocence that was once there this time  the trio know they are about to embark on something extraordinary and the scenery is beautiful in this scene i get goosebumps at the 1  00 mark  well  these were my favorites out of the harry potter and the halfblood prince  original motion picture soundtrack   none of you necessarily have to go all out like i did i d just like to know what your favorite <URL>  s  waswere and maybe even why music is a beautiful thing and i m glad there s composers like john williams  nicholas hooper  patrick doyle  and alexandre desplat that make exceptional music and if you ve watched all the films  but never really looked into the soundtracks  i suggest you give some a listen you might surprise yourself at how they are at conveying raw emotion and giving you nostalgia as well as making you remember the scenes throughout the films 
307,harrypotter,racism  in early 20th century america  inconceivable 
308,harrypotter,but you still can catch up  rpottermorewritings has everything compiled 
309,harrypotter,whenever i see nomaj  i think of nomad and inexplicably  nicki minaj   __ 
310,harrypotter,on a related note  did snape s soul rip when he killed dumbledore 
311,harrypotter,nothing new to contribute but i have to say this  what a brilliant question and what brilliant discussions and answers    bravo rharrypotter  bravo
312,harrypotter,this is a mighty good question  it does beg the question of how normal deaths by spells dont create them  and some do as we are lead to believe that avada kedavra on harrys mum made an accidental horcrux  so  its not even as if you kill them with  make a horcrux killing spell   so why doesnt it randomnly do so at least on other occasions
313,harrypotter,i thought this would be an interesting question to debate  it says in the text that killing rips the soul  and molly totally killed bellatrix  but does that rule apply in all circumstances  or does killing in self defense  or while defending your child  not rip the soul  what do yall think 
314,harrypotter,i just think it sounds stupid because it does nt sound much like american slang  honestly  something that sounds slightly racist would probably be fitting 
315,harrypotter,can you include some information that s in pottermore  i ve never visited the website
316,harrypotter,the idea sound awesome it would be like reading lord of the rings with the silmarillion being footnotes and excursions   d
317,harrypotter,it strikes me as something that would be printed in the quibbler with its seemingly nonsensical nature as well as the symbols along the border which is reminiscent of the quirky format the quibbler uses to print dates and times at a glance  it looks to be a mix of alchemical symbols and planetary symbols however i remember reading somewhere about minalima utilizing certain symbols for a lot of their stuff like the quibbler and possibly some book covers as well as articles in the daily prophet i forget what the term was that they used but they did nt call them sigils  seals  or runes  and i think it was nt something specifically belonging to the occult lol  if anyone happens to know which article this is  please let me know xd   sorry  that was very vague but anyway  that symbol on the right just below the  2  and above the  s   is the alchemical symbol for cinnabar  i believe the triangle symbols at the very top and bottom are a little odd looking as they look like the air symbol inverted andor flipped upside down but without the line intersecting through the triangle as it normally would so i m not to sure about that as triangles without an intersecting line are the symbols for fire and water the symbol at the top left corner was listed as  iron vitreol  on one site but i do nt see that symbol on many alchemical charts so i m not to sure about that one the right half of it looks like the alchemical symbol for leadsaturn though all in all  i d say it s probably just a nice page designed to look mysterious and esotericy but if this coloring book page actually did have a hidden meaning  i d be seriously impressed  d
318,harrypotter,what  if any  new subjects do you think hogwarts would offer today 
319,harrypotter,in hbp right after they ve had potions and they saw the amortentia  love potion   on p 192  hang on   said a voice close by harry s left ear  and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in slughorn s dungeon he looked around and saw that ginny had joined them  harry s amortentia smells like ginny  never caught that first readhappy amortentia day  hope you guys enjoyed it 
320,harrypotter,ginny    what about me       cries 
321,harrypotter,you know i always thought  maybe he just liked the smell of the perfume  leave it to harry to not know what he likes
322,harrypotter,whew  barely made it in time 
323,harrypotter,looks like a millicent bulstrode if i ever saw one 
324,harrypotter,prob had an invite your brothersister to work day
325,harrypotter,maybe it was goyle s twin sister  the movies deviated from the books alot so you never know 
326,harrypotter,my husband s funny valentine  
327,harrypotter,i bet a  box of chocolate cauldrons     <URL>   would make your night special   so if anyone wants to take a piece of chocolate to try and get  a date tonight    let me know that you want one     <URL>   remember  the longer you let them sit  the stronger they are  
328,harrypotter,voldy ca nt love it must ve been from someone else
329,harrypotter,what do we know of merlin in the wizarding world  legendary characters and lore fascinates me is there a good wiki or page with this information 
330,harrypotter,in the slytherin acceptance letter it says that merlin was a slytherin that s all we really know 
331,harrypotter,thing every one shuld know abuot merlin  he was one of the most powerful wizards of all time  he was in slytherin house  he had a beard  edit  i dont know why the formatting is nt working   edit252  fixed
332,harrypotter,are nt boggarts afraid of themselves being seen 
333,harrypotter,that s super cool  thanks for sharing 
334,harrypotter,tea and butterbeer   my dear  you know it s either  champagne     <URL>  or nothing 
335,harrypotter,the disillusionment charm i suppose 
336,harrypotter,the internet has won i need nothing else today 
337,harrypotter,the wiki page is still restricted 
338,harrypotter,i have tickets for back to back parts 1 amp  2 on september 4th i need to sell does anyone know about transferring ownership  i know ticketmaster in the states is very particular about that and these tickets are will call 
339,harrypotter,i love pogo 
340,harrypotter,my friend and i do a podcast twice a week in which we review original music from the internet for one of our episodes this week i was thinking we d talk about wizard rock  we re aware of draco and the malfoys are there any other groups that are nt terrible 
341,harrypotter,oliver boyd and the remembralls
342,harrypotter,i am collecting all the harry potter video games and i need sorcerer s stone for gamecube let me know with any leads or offers i m already checking ebay thanks 
343,harrypotter,1 i think he had more harryfavoritism than gryffindor sure  he let sirius stay  but he also let draco stay even after his assassination plot nearly killed ron and katie as you mentioned in your other points  there were other bad teachers too that dumbledore kept for his own reasons snape could have ended up hufflepuff s head of house and dumbledore would have kept him  2 so much truth i wonder if he tried to relabel the dada class to break the curse  it did nt work  and he just decided students just had to be taught  3 i think that because dumbledore was such a genius  he always believed nobody would comprehend his plans within plans they could nt keep up with him so  he left them behind only he knew all because only he could comprehend all the moral implications mattered less than the logic  to be fair to dumbledore  he recognized some of his own issues it was nt enough to really change his behavior  but it was enough for him to try and avoid the minister of magic position and to acknowledge that despite his vast knowledge and power  it was harry that had the real power to end things thinking of it in terms of the three brothers fairytale  dumbledore would have liked to be the humble and wise third brother instead  he was the arrogant second brother who wanted to bring back the dead dumbledore admires harry for being what he could not he recognizes his flaws  but ca nt <URL> them he deliberately passes the torch onto someone who can  so  he was very  very questionable  but he s also like a greek tragedy i pity him a bit 
344,harrypotter,because molly wanted to account for all eventualities ron came home after first year saying hermione s parents were dentist  so molly added that strange dentist  place just in case ron went to visit  i m more curious about what prompted molly and arthur to include prison
345,harrypotter,arthur probably just heard it somewhere and included it out of excitement 
346,harrypotter,there are a couple inconsistencies about dentistry in the movies  for example  in diagon alley  there is a sign for  surgical and dental operator  as well i think it s just a movie thing though i do nt recall anything in the books indicating that wizards are familiar with mugglestyle dentistry 
347,harrypotter,movies do not equal books books are canon movies are not it s a small detail i think that would bypass the author s input 
348,harrypotter,because whoever created the clock has nt read the books  obviously 
349,harrypotter,well i m not sure if this will help a whole lot if there are any game stores near you that sell retro games  yes i died a little inside calling the gamecube retro  there s a chance they have it or if they do nt talk to the owner of the store usually with small business game stores the owner has a personal collection or knows collectors that they could contact for you i hope this is of help 
350,harrypotter,fully grown madrakes would be my guess
351,harrypotter,you look really cool  how did you make this  and how long did it take you 
352,harrypotter,gt  oh this will be great a weasley clock that probably does nt even move let alone work s     gt  that is literally the coolest thing i have ever seen it actually  works  just like magic 
353,harrypotter,xpost referenced from rdiy by utbornottb3  harry potterinspired family clock     <URL>         i   am   a   bot   made   for   your   convenience     especially   for   mobile   users      contact     <URL>  to  originalpostsearcher        code     <URL>        faq     <URL>  faq

356,harrypotter,this is a blank checkwrite down any amount of money on this piece of paper  and i will pay 
357,harrypotter,well done  thats really cool  id go as so far as to say it should be highly marketable 
358,harrypotter,incredible  well done i bloody love it 
359,harrypotter,is it possible to learn this power 
360,harrypotter,this is insane  and the best harry potter diy i ve ever seen the  magical  future is now  
361,harrypotter,i so need to do this oo my friends showed me this and asked if we could do this we have now decided on making it with spoons  i think i hope  we will find a way at least oo
362,harrypotter,holy fucking shit you sir are amazing  and i do nt think i have been this impressed all year  2016   i will throw in another resounding  sell these and make tons of money  because i would buy 10 i m wondering if i could somehow get my electrician friends and my engineering friends together could they help me make one of these my mom would love this she does nt know a thing about harry potter  but she always wants to know where everyone is and what they re doing 
363,harrypotter,i wan na see a video of it so bad  now 
364,harrypotter,omfg  please tell me you re selling these 
365,harrypotter,so what s the requirement for the clock to light  mortal peril   a panic button on the phone  heartbeat measurer  any fastfood place 
366,harrypotter,this is brilliant  good work and man does it look great too 
367,harrypotter,holy shit balls you could make a killing selling these 
368,harrypotter,i used to be ambivalent about him but  sirius black in the span of one night  harry goes from fear of being murdered by him  to being ready to follow him home like a puppy sirius being his dad s best friend notwithstanding  harry still does nt know the guy hell  harry does nt even know his dad i get that living with the dursleys sucked  but damn  and this is all before we knew what a jerkass he was in school he sent snape off to go see remus in his werewolf form when james found out  he was the one who saved snape from being attacked which means that sirius was nt going to do anything to stop it he was going to let one of his best friends eat the weird kid 
369,harrypotter,this is one of the most amazing and impressive things i have ever seen it s admirable how much work and attention evidently went into this i need this to be a permanent fixture in my house 
370,harrypotter,  dolores umbridge    she s absolutely despicable  i loathed her all the way through the ootp  and then when we saw her again in the dh  i could nt believe how nice she d found the new regime and how she fit in it  even though she was never a death eater 
371,harrypotter,that s really awesome       youtubenl6cdfn2i3i  i would have loved that as my hall in college 
372,harrypotter,petunia when you re introduced to vernon and petunia  you get the feeling that vernon is the one who is out to get harry the most  what with the ridiculous antics in reality  petunia has a grudge about seven miles wide and is almost entirely aware of what harry potter represents to the wizarding world at large  and  keeps him in a cupboard under the stairs out of spite  
373,harrypotter,i love it   
374,harrypotter,when tumblr catches up with what fanfiction has been saying for ten years
375,harrypotter,this is totally fine if all you are doing is not inviting muggle born wizards once you start killing off muggleborn wizards you have gone way to far  slytherin was a bad person 
376,harrypotter,i do nt know where have you been all these years they would nt be so popular if they were nt good 
377,harrypotter,so could the reason he chose a basilisk as the chamber s keeper be so that in the case of a mugglemuggleborn attack  he could use the basilisk to petrify all the muggleborn in the castle  aside from the fact he could speak parsletounge and control it   that way they would nt die  just be turned to stone so they could nt do anymore damage or at least until they stopped whatever attack was happening 
378,harrypotter,interesting theory  i really enjoyed the first few posts in the chain  though i think it goes off the rails a bit towards the end  i had two points to make first  i may be mistaken about the username  but i believe that user datvikingtho implies that slytherin did not put the basilisk there  that riddle did that s absolutely false as jk rowling states that basilisks can live thousands of years  making it entirely possible for it to be placed there by salazar secondly riddle was still an underage wizard when he opened the chamber the first time i would argue he was hardly qualified to train and capture a 50 ft snake monster  parseltounge or not you can argue slytherin had his reasons to be paranoid of muggleborns  but to cast the chamber of secrets as a personal panicroom whose history is slandered by the horribly biased founders is a little ludicrous imo  second  the user psychopompious goes on a gushfest about how amazing slytherin is in the last paragraph and states gt   i think a lot of people forget that slytherin house is more than just selfpreservation too    loyalty is a core value   slytherin  s message is about protecting your own more than nearly anything else slytherin pushes   unquestioning acceptance of and loyalty to your fellows  regardless of blood status    even in harry  s day  according to their <URL> message on pottermore  i think that loyalty is hufflepuff s thing mostly  and i think this re appropriation to sytherin is a bit bias and unfair slytherin house is known mostly for their   cunning   and   desire to succeed   than  loyalty   slytherin may not have been a bad dude  but i do nt know if i would paint him as some selfless martyr as she does in the second half of her post  this may be a nitpick  but i wanted to clarify it other than that i thought it was an insightful post  even if it laid the unrequited syltherin love on a little too thick in places for my taste 
379,harrypotter,if you re curious as to what made me watch them all for some reason  this     <URL>  v  lrsneqani3k  did it  also what do i do with my life now   
380,harrypotter,people on this sub like to run the movies down all the time compared to the books the storytelling is just okay  but they do stand on their own quite well i enjoy them  definitely  but i do nt watch them as often as i read the books 
381,harrypotter,why does it sound racist  i do nt get it d  i think it sounds pretty good  but then i m not american i dunno  in my head it just sounds like  nomad  but with a j  seems decent to me muggle sounds equally as silly imo 
382,harrypotter,maybe because love fueled that kill 
383,harrypotter,fawkes  theme and leaving hogwarts just beautiful  magical and moving 
384,harrypotter,you usually have to stir with a wand and sometimes say a spell when the potion is through  so i would say muggles would nt be able to brew a potion 
385,harrypotter, you smell like magical roofies 
386,harrypotter,harry why do nt you give my  autograph     <URL>  to ginny 
387,harrypotter,eh  i think they fucking suck there s an art to adapting novels to movies  and those movies are a course in how not to do it as adaptations  they cut out important themes while adding content that does more harm than good on their own merits  they re shallow  inconsistent and incoherent 
388,harrypotter,the character credence has been listed as a character from current potter cannon  we know he was a teenager in 1927 and living in america the actor looks like a young tom riddle  severus snape  or salazar slytherin  what are the popular theories on who credence <URL> 
389,harrypotter,1  iirc  jkr was a classics major she knows this  2  i think  given her extensive study of the classics   this     enwikipediaorgwikihermione_   mythology    is as likely a source  although less cool 3  to be completely fair  i think the original mythological figure in 2 was also likely named after hermes  in one aspect or another   so i still think this is pretty awesome
390,harrypotter,he is referenced a few times  but nothing much is told of him in the booksmovies 
391,harrypotter,i ve always thought getting some background information on merlin and how he influenced the wizarding world would have been very cool 
392,harrypotter,i read the books between <SMILE> and 14 as they came out  so i did nt retain a whole lot the first time through  she gives harry a lot more detention and shows absolutely no remorse for actually physically abusing him in fact  she often says he needs more i also just finished the chapter where she bans him  fred  and george from the quidditch team i completely forgot about that and man does it piss me off especially when she says she decided to go to fudge when mcgonagalldumbledore allowed the gryffindor team to reform and when she says she wants their brooms confiscated and put in her office  i knew i hated her  but now i m relearning why 
393,harrypotter,i felt the exact same way when i re read she honestly made it hard for me to read 
394,harrypotter,i hate her more and more every time i ve reread them fred and george are my hero s in the book because of their defiance to umbridge though she did pretty much seal their pursuit foe a joke shop 
395,harrypotter,hi  i got some questions i want to ask about the films i ve never read the books  but i plan to   and i guessed this would be the best place to ask them i m also on mobile so please tell me if the formatting is dodgy  first one is why was nt harry angry at dumbledore after harry died   he saw snape s memory of dumbledore manipulating harry into  raising him as pig to slaughter  yet when he saw him he did nt seem too bothered  in fact he looked like he still admired him  another question is what do you think harry thinks of his father after seeing snape s memory of him  cause to me it looked like he was a bully and stole lilly from him was there something that snape did that gave james the right to do that to him  or was it snape s hate for james that literally changed his memory  where did harry get the mirror shard and where did the mirror even come from  i ve looked through the films and there s no mention of it but then in the deathly hallows harry suddenly has it with no explanation  one more  what is the significance of snape s patronus  i know he loved lilly  but when dumbledore just randomly mentions lilly when he casts the doe  it s not really clear what he means  does he just ask if he loved her  would make sense after snape s  always   thanks guys i do love this subreddit  harry potter is pretty much my favourite film series as i grew up as the same age as harry and the lot  definitely an experience that i loved but did nt know was happening at the time 
396,harrypotter,this is the problem with watching the movies first     read the books asap the movies are fun entertainment but you wo nt get nearly as much out of them as you will out of the books i hope you get to soon and you re enjoying your hp journey  i can try to answer some of your questions  in the books harry goes through some more emotions about dumbledore having known he would need to die ultimately i think he comes out still admiring dumbledore because he knew how hard it was for him and that this was the only choice also  he was going through so many emotions about his own life that being mad at someone else was nt at the top of his mind  i think the jamessnape thing is very much up for debate i ve heard a lot of insightful things on this sub though  the mirror was from sirius he gave it to him as a gift there are two that are connected  the idea being sirius had one and harry had one and they would be able to talk through them   someone correct me if i m wrong but i think aberforth gets the other one after it was stolen from grimmauld place by mundungus  lily is represented by a doe this makes sense because she and james were together and his animagus  and probably patronus  was a stag the patronus is important because it is much stronger evidence that he still loves lily than just saying he does they talk about how only something really powerful emotionally can change a person s patronus  hope this helps other people help me out if i ve missed stuff i m sure i ve messed up a lot of spelling  sorry about that 
397,harrypotter,someone s got  neverending story  in their brain   
398,harrypotter,well  yeah 
399,harrypotter,this is my first post  ca nt wait to be apart of the wonderful world you guys have made here  i first read the series probably five or more years ago  but i ve been rereading them over the past six months or so  and i m always impressed by jk s literary prowess  i just finished  goblet of fire   and i wanted to share an example with you guys of foreshadowing  three whole books in advance   that i only realized my third pass through the book this is the scene towards the end of the book in which dumbledore is questioning harry about what happened in the graveyard it s the part where harry tells dumbledore and sirius about wormtail taking his blood  695696   gt  when harry told of wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger  however  sirius let out a vehement exclamation and dumbledore stood up so quickly that harry started dumbledore walked around the desk and told harry to stretch out his arm harry showed them both the place where his robes were torn and the cut beneath them  gt   he said my blood would make him stronger than if he d used someone else s   harry told dumbledore  he said the protection my  my mother left in me  he d have it too and he was right  he could touch me without hurting himself  he touched my face  gt  for a fleeting instant  harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in dumbledore s eyes but next second  harry was sure he had imagined it  for when dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk  he looked as old and weary as harry had ever seen him  i m fairly sure that  triumph  is foreshadowing for the end of  deathly hallows  where dumbledore explains to harry that  by taking harry s blood  voldemort keeps harry alive even in his death it s only one sentence  and it s buried pretty deeply in the fourth book  but it shows not only jk s concrete knowledge of the future of the plot  but also dumbledore s knowledge of harry s future and the hope that voldemort s arrogance has created  the books are riddled  ha  with all sorts of examples like this  and they really do show how well jk had the story laid out years ahead of time as a fan rereading the series  these are the little details that make you glad you chose to read again  edit  formatting
400,harrypotter,i would imagine so one example  sirius mentioned communicating with crookshanks when he was in dog form so cross magical creature communication was possible i also would think that a legilimens would be able to at least read the emotions or feelings of an animal  even if they do nt have linguistic capabilities 
401,harrypotter,arthur is obsessed with muggles 
402,harrypotter,this one is nt nearly as monumental as the foreshadowing you mentioned but one of the instances of foreshadowing i always though was cool was madam rosmerta in hbp right before the part where katie bell is almost killed by the necklace harry  ron  and hermione are in the 3 broomsticks and ron is looking around trying to catch a glimpse of madam rosmerta hermione asks ron what he s looking for and ron says  nothing   hermione responds with something to the effect of  i expect nothing s in the back getting more firewhiskey   in reality though she was already under malfoy s imperius curse in the woman s restroom waiting for a hogwarts student to give the necklace too 
403,harrypotter,is there any way you can make one for me too   please 
404,harrypotter,this is incredible and you re still in school  you shame me 
405,harrypotter,bc movie
406,harrypotter,would you ever post more detailed instructions on how to make this  i would love to start this project but have no idea how i would sync this up to my iphone location 
407,harrypotter,i do nt get what the letters  that light up  stand for or why there are two rows of them 
408,harrypotter, aggressive feelings     <URL> 
409,harrypotter,this is excellent  
410,harrypotter,i wish i could buy this
411,harrypotter,this is amazing  i need one 
412,harrypotter,holy shit you could sell these  i would totally buy one shut up and take my money 
413,harrypotter,while this is awesome  and truly a great design feat i feel i should mention that  in my experience  those location based ifttt triggers deplete cell phone battery very quickly ymmv
414,harrypotter,you and i live in the same town go duke 
415,harrypotter,why was nt arthur weasley mortal peril whenever i m near enough to him 
416,harrypotter,the scene in ootp where she humiliates hagrid during one of his lessons fills me with so much rage the fact that she gets so much joy from having power over other people  i ca nt handle it  i found  this writing     <URL>  about umbridge from jk rowling pretty enjoyable  though   
417,harrypotter,that s so cool  this new film is going to bring a huge surge in new hp art 
418,harrypotter,we know cats  snakes  frogs  and owls are all magical animals maybe wizards could be born to understand these magical creatures  i ca nt imagine non magical animals have a corresponding magical language 
419,harrypotter,muggles privy to the wizarding world via a book series  the ministry would be all over that 
420,harrypotter,i was literally reading this part last night and thought the exact same thing great find   the best thing about rereading the series is that you pick up small details like this each time i ve just finished gof for the fourth time now and i ve found some new small detail like this every time  you have to admire jk s thought process when writing these books  she clearly had the whole thing planned out very well these small hints are evidence of that 
421,harrypotter,it would be so perfect and so ironic that those who are disowned from the family would be the ones to carry on the family name the blacks tried so hard to be the pictureperfect wizarding family that they forced their family to <URL> what embarrassed them the most 
422,harrypotter,absolutely  i m sure that dumbledore could not think of any way to get harry through this alive when he heard what voldemort had done  it must have been a great wave of relief 
423,harrypotter,i would be interested i ve reread them many many times but would be happy to again 
424,harrypotter,mother of merlin 
425,harrypotter,those are amazing 
426,harrypotter,good post  that man needed recognition
427,harrypotter,too bad it was nt a gryffindor   say  stebbins  how do you feel about lions   rawr  
428,harrypotter,that s a crazy good catch i reread them over summer last year and i caught a ton of stuff but this one escaped me nice job
429,harrypotter,there are quite a few moments like this  voldemort tells his death eaters that he has traveled further along the path to immortality than any other wizard  which is a clear hint at his experimentation with horcruxes 
430,harrypotter,i have a doubt here why did the expression change from concern to triumph  i get the triumph  part but why the concern  
431,harrypotter,that s really cool  lucky you  
432,harrypotter,i got the sense that it has to be an object  in the traditional sense the very nature of its purpose suggests that it should be able to be hidden it seems to need to be solid it definitely needs to be comprised of physical matter  otherwise how could you contain your soul within it  again  it needs to be a traditional object i have no idea about the moon  you d have to get there  as well as be able to perform the ritual to make it a horcrux  which might be difficult  but who knows  the ocean  almost certainly not liquids do nt seem like they could be made into horcruxes too much flux 
433,harrypotter,it looks like so much fun 
434,harrypotter,it looks so real 
435,harrypotter,nothing has been confirmed  but i d assume it would have to be something you have some sort of emotional attachment to voldemort had an attachment to hogwarts  thus the reason he was able to use house artifacts 
436,harrypotter,well the sorting hat ca nt see the future  only try and predict what the student will develop into hell  what 11 year old is mature enough to exhibit the traits of modesty  loyalty  and hard work  or wisdom and knowledge  cunning  ambition  of course the sorting hat is wrong  but maybe snape wanted slytherin due to legacy  peter because he wanted right be brave  something he was nt  remember  the hat can be influenced or maybe even tricked 
437,harrypotter, auroreo   dark mark chocolate  god i love puns 
438,harrypotter,it s amazing how you just happen to know the guy who made the glasses for harry potter
439,harrypotter,an annotated harry potter series  yes 
440,harrypotter,gt  this home that snape lives in is the same home he grew up in why on earth would he stay there  he has no love for that house at all he hated his father he resented his mother his childhood there was awful why stay at spinner s end  for me  it would be like sirius wanting to stay at grimmauld place  it s also the home and area where he grew up and met lily where he and lily became childhood friends i imagine he goes for walks and frequents those same places that they used to spend time 
441,harrypotter,usnogkingstebbins do nt care  just like the honey badger  now  molly had just poured me a cup of t  e     <URL>  abut where did i put it  i suspect those fine nargles xeno lovegood is always on about 
442,harrypotter,<URL>  little lady  here s  something     <URL>  just for you  i hope you positively  love  it 
443,harrypotter,just like 20 dollars is 20 dollars  10 points is 10 points ya feel 
444,harrypotter,you should also listen to the audio tapes  c 
445,harrypotter,snape snape severus snape
446,harrypotter,rewatching all the movies  since i just finished the books for the first time   and while watching the sorceressphilosophers stone earlier today i started thinking about the dudley house question when hagrid mistook him for harry i think he could be hufflepuff or maybe even gryffindor 
447,harrypotter,he s pretty much a muggle crabbe or goyle  so slytherin 
448,harrypotter,re snape   i sometimes think we sort too soon 
449,harrypotter,so tired of this retroactive sorting oh  hold on a momentthere s a character i think is a terrible person in gryffindor and a character i no longer think is a terrible person in slytherin  they must be missorted  obviously all the good guys go in gryffindor and all the bad guys go in slytherin  such bullshit  i ve offered my arguments on here about peter s sorting before  and i d be happy to do it again if anyone wants  but quick summary  peter was brave  bold  and daring and was decidedly lacking in a  proper  drive to selfpreservation and why would snape be in gryffindor  he s introverted  cool  and cynical  which i find correlates with the slytherin house and let s not pretend he is nt selfpreserving  snape is  ours   peter is  gryffindor s   the allknowing hat has spoken 
450,harrypotter,gt  peter was the least gryffindor person ever he s basically the biggest coward in the series i do nt know what house he could belong to  but definitely not gryffindor  ucavelioness posted this excellent post to why peter in gryffindor was the right choice   he was courageous plenty of times he just did nt have any pride  that is  he did nt mind crying and blubbering and pleading for his life so his words were never courageous  but his actions were almost always physically brave i do nt have the super big list  but here are some of his actions that could be considered brave  stayed friends with remus after he found out he was a werewolf worked to <URL> an animagus without adult guidance the animagus transformation can go horribly  nightmarishly wrong as a rat  ran with three larger animals who could easily have trampled him month after month not to mention there s a shitload of owls around hogwarts  being a rat outside would be very risky  i d say  he was a spy for voldemort for over a year yeah  it s treacherous  but it took some nerve especially once dumbledore suspected a spy do nt forget snape did the same thing the opposite way and for that  harry called snape the bravest man he ever knew  thought fast and ruthlessly and efficiently framed sirius after godric s hollow cut off his own finger without a whimper and coldly massmurdered 12 people  seized his opportunity to escape after the shrieking shack  even though he d been informed that he would be killed if he tried to transform he waited for the right moment and took a gamble with his life  and it paid off  he argues with voldemort when he does nt agree with a plan  and the plan in gof was pretty convoluted and bloated  he speaks up even though he s afraid only gryffindor death eater  only death eater we see do this coincidence  the man cuts off his own hand voldemort was nt forcing him  he was already in the cauldron peter does this alone and of his own violation  he reminds voldemort of his promise after voldemort was reborn  he did nt really need peter any more and could have killed him  and peter knows this  but he still manages a reproachful  you promised   seriously  no one else treats the dark lord anything like this 
451,harrypotter,i m always surprised how many redditers live near me 
452,harrypotter,maybe peter pettigrew would have embraced his inner bravery if he was nt hanging out with james  sirius and remus maybe those 3 looking after him and protecting him all the time  actually made him a bigger coward than he was  because he never got the opportunity to stand up for himself he got so used to them being for him each and every time that he never realized that is not how life is supposed to work this naturally makes him think of saving his own skin than his friends  and makes succumb to voldemort s power who knows  if neville had hung out with the golden trio all the damn time  then he might have never stood up for himself either a little independence will go a long way in building one s courage 
453,harrypotter,i grew up right down the street from that bakery i moved away <SMILE> months ago for college and now my heart hurts  
454,harrypotter,the two that stick out to me are dumbledore and hagrid  jk does have a tendency especially in the earlier books to put all the good guys in gryffindor  the bad guys in slytherin  and filler characters in the other houses she tries to redeem this later in the series with characters like luna and tonks but she ca nt change what she had already published  dumbledore and hagrid serve as two sides of the  fatherfigure  for harry at hogwarts  so it would make sense that they were in the the same house as him we also find out their house affiliations in the first two books  where the gryffindorslytherin dichotomy is at its most obvious  both have many gryffindor traits hagrid shows his bravery in situations of crisis like when he s arrested in cos and fights off the ministry officials in ootp but i ve always thought that hagrid would make an excellent hufflepuff he s unassuming and loyal to a fault to the people in his life  especially harry and dumbledore   he s a hard worker  seeing as he has been groundskeeper forever and takes on a teaching position on top of that he has an affinity for magical creatures and the outdoors like many hufflepuffs  although his cooking skills are nt quite up to helga s standards   yes there are moments when he is unpuff  like showing harry the dragons   importantly hufflepuff corresponds with the earth element  and you wo nt find an earthier guy than hagrid he s kind to a fault to students  unless they re mean to him   and often has students to his hut when they re lonely or down  dumbledore has gotten way more discussion in this thread  so i ll say less about him he could ve been a great slytherin or ravenclaw since a lot of people have made the slytherin argument  i ll make the ravenclaw one he s one of the most brilliant wizards to ever come out of hogwarts they talk about him wowing professors with theory when he is a student and it looks like he does a fair bit of independent research while at school he s also a total oddball and those types thrive in ravenclaw he has an insatiable desire for knowledge as well
455,harrypotter, auroreo cookie  this is an amazing creation 
456,harrypotter,oh man  i live very near here  i know what i m doing this week   d
457,harrypotter,if you already preordered  you get the lowest price it s listed for so all of us who preordered the  30  are now getting it for  1<SMILE> 
458,harrypotter,i live right around the corner from this restaurant   i know where i m going for brunch next week 
459,harrypotter,they also have 3 pop rides consisting of the hogwarts express engine and 2 carriages  with harry  ron and hermonie in one section each
460,harrypotter,in case anyone wants prints    <URL>
461,harrypotter,supposedly  magic and technology do nt exactly get along but would a fixing spell work on electronics 
462,harrypotter,reparo seems to fix physical damage so maybe but it may be difficult  this wire with this wire and that here and this here  as even a millimeter mistake means it wo nt work so something like an old radio will be ok  a new cell phone will be far more difficult i wonder if the wizard has to know the object to repair it 
463,harrypotter,i ve wondered this before  too in hbp  slughorn and dumbledore do some kind of magic to repair all of the items in the muggle house that slughorn destroyed in an attempt to hide not sure how many of the items are slughorn s and how many are the muggles   and maybe none of them are electronic  but they seem to put them all back together again with no problems  maybe it has to do with the relative skill of the witchwizard and their knowledge of the broken items 
464,harrypotter,maybe  i hope so  it would it would be very useful
465,harrypotter,well no  because the others would realise and tell him  especially hermione   it has to be something less obvious 
466,harrypotter,my take on why most electronics can not not work in a magical environment is because magic  as a field of energy interferes with the electric field and jams the current or something we see that it takes a great deal of effort to modify electronic equipment before they can work with magic  eg mr weasley s efforts with the car  although how ron could use the fellytone  remains to be explained   so i m guessing that work goes into vanishing all electric related components  such as wires  magnets  circuit boards  and replacing them with some other thing  i would presume magic would be unable to repair electronics  since it stops them from working even when not broken however uelstren suggested  a milimeter mistake means it wo nt work   which suggest it might be a scaling issueperhaps it requires a lot of precision and an ability to move things at a very small scale which most wizards or witches would nt be familiar with in their daytoday use of magic i expect eventually a really bright muggleborn will figure this out and invent a new type of spell that would tap on the electric field itself to achieve the minute changes required to repair electronics  but woah  this is venturing into a whole new area haha edit  added more thoughts
467,harrypotter,yes it does  but if the electronic is too damaged then it would depend on the skill of the wizard  you do not need to know how the item works or its parts or whatever  just intent and the incantation will do harry could not make the liquid go back to the basin once he broke it  but slughorn and dumbledore did it with the dragon blood that was on the walls 
468,harrypotter,i love the cos one i know it does nt seem so  wizardy  but all the elements are there amazing 
469,harrypotter,more than anything  it shows how different the look of the movies changed after a new director came on for poa 
470,harrypotter,gt  this home that snape lives in is the same home he grew up in why on earth would he stay there  he has no love for that house at all he hated his father he resented his mother his childhood there was awful why stay at spinner s end  for me  it would be like sirius wanting to stay at grimmauld place  i think there s a part of snape s psyche that feels he  deserves  to be in despair  as a sort of punishment for allowing lily to come to harm  and also for throwing his lot in with the death eaters in the first place this would explain why he walks around with such a miserable attitude  always wearing a sneer on his face and constantly belittling his students in a pathetic attempt to elevate himself a part of him really believes that he is  supposed  to be miserable  and that s why he brings himself back to his childhood home  the place where he felt nothing but misery growing up 
471,harrypotter,i think it would be a bunch of tiny colorful particles just floating together and then when they take the shape of a person s fear  those tiny colorful particles come together and create 
472,harrypotter,gt  it s mentioned a couple of times that snape s attitude towards bellatrix is mocking he is amused by her and it kinda makes me think that snape almost enjoys his role as double agent he likes to be important he likes the mystery of it and he enjoys being the smartest one in the room i think that last one is important he would nt mock voldemort would he  but he enjoys hiding the truth from someone he considers lesser like bellatrix  i agree i think he s also amused by the fact that he  as a halfblood  is able to assert himself as superior to staunch purebloods like bellatrix  nee black   it s certainly a perversion of voldemort s trust to make bellatrix think the dark lord trusts a  filthy halfblood  over a member of the most honorable house of black 
473,harrypotter,i always imagined a boggart would look like this    bulbapediabulbagardennetwikisableye_  pok  c3  a9mon 
474,harrypotter,i cant imagine anyone getting into hp from just watching the movies because they re a horrible misinterpretation of the books i suppose the millions of plot holes in them get people reading which is a good thing 
475,harrypotter,i think they re overthinking a throwaway joke
476,harrypotter,a divination chart  the sun in the middle makes me think it s astrology related 
477,harrypotter,coloring it in correctly allows you to summon demons
478,harrypotter,it strikes me as something that would be printed in the quibbler with its seemingly nonsensical nature as well as the symbols along the border which is reminiscent of the quirky format the quibbler uses to print dates and times at a glance  it looks to be a mix of alchemical symbols and planetary symbols however i remember reading somewhere about minalima utilizing certain symbols for a lot of their stuff like the quibbler and possibly some book covers as well as articles in the daily prophet i forget what the term was that they used but they did nt call them sigils  seals  or runes  and i think it was nt something specifically belonging to the occult lol  if anyone happens to know which article this is  please let me know xd   sorry  that was very vague but anyway  that symbol on the right just below the  2  and above the  s   is the alchemical symbol for cinnabar  i believe the triangle symbols at the very top and bottom are a little odd looking as they look like the air symbol inverted andor flipped upside down but without the line intersecting through the triangle as it normally would so i m not to sure about that as triangles without an intersecting line are the symbols for fire and water the symbol at the top left corner was listed as  iron vitreol  on one site but i do nt see that symbol on many alchemical charts so i m not to sure about that one the right half of it looks like the alchemical symbol for leadsaturn though all in all  i d say it s probably just a nice page designed to look mysterious and esotericy but if this coloring book page actually did have a hidden meaning  i d be seriously impressed  d
479,harrypotter,thats the bs3 chart  
480,harrypotter,probably arithmancy or ancient runes 
481,harrypotter,i study ancient runes in my spare time most of the symbols in the border are runes 
482,harrypotter,the small symbols on the outside border are the symbols of planets  so that hints at astronomy 
483,harrypotter,it s clearly not page threehundred and fortynine ten points from gryffindor 
484,harrypotter,wait til my father here s about this 
485,harrypotter,awesome drawing 
486,harrypotter,wow  did you do this yourself  
487,harrypotter,wow  that s so well done  i can draw a good outlet  
488,harrypotter,its a mad house    a mad house    
489,harrypotter,can i have your talent please   this is amazing 
490,harrypotter,tom riddle took ginny in order to lure harry into the chamber so that he could kill him he specifically says at one point that  killing mudbloods does nt interest  him  anymore  and that getting harry has been his real purpose for a while 
491,harrypotter,i hope so cause i really wan na go to one 
492,harrypotter,ok i lost my shit pretty bad on this one saved it to my desktop for future laughs lol
493,harrypotter,is it because he s hiding it and it s not really  magic   muggles would just think it s a torch  
494,harrypotter,he s not allowed the movies just thought it d look cool so they ignored the rules harry does nt cast the spell in the book 
495,harrypotter,it s a moviething  and it s wrong he can not perform magic at the dursley household before he s 17 even magic performed around him when no adult wizardwitch is supposed to be nearby can get him into trouble that s how he gets a warning when dobby does the magic in cos that s the law dealing with underage magic muggles seeing it is a separate law that deals with breaking magical secrecy  in ootp  harry casts a patronus in little whingings and is charged with breaking 2 laws 
496,harrypotter,i see it as more of a flashlight than a spell at that point
497,harrypotter,book wise  he ca nt  movie wise  however  i d like to think that perhaps <URL> third years were given an assignment by flitwick to practice that particular spell or something  and thus the ministry would be notified beforehand 
498,harrypotter,yes  it just depends on where i ve seen multiple people online say their local bookstores are planning midnight release parties already maybe check with a local bookstore and let them know you re interested and they might announce something 
499,harrypotter,i ca nt figure out if it s supposed to be astronomy  arithmancy  or ancient runes a good number of the symbols around the edge are astrological symbols for planets and such  but there does nt seem to be a pattern and it makes no sense it s been driving me crazy the whole time i ve been coloring it 
500,harrypotter,the top comment in this  thread     <URL>  suggests that parseltongues could be magically attenuated to speaking to snakes  however elsewhere on this reddit and i believe jkr herself said it can not be learned we know genetics  of sorts  plays into it some  so are there natural felinetongues  aviriatoungues  rodentiatongues that we do nt know about out there  of course i m asking for wild speculation here as the canon does nt talk about it much and seems to keep parseltongues on par with voldy so no character wants to explore it in the books for fear of being named a deatheater or whatever irrational nonsense comes to mind 
501,harrypotter, felinetongues  filch  ms figg   just kidding  althought it would be awesome 
502,harrypotter,i think parseltongue can be a learned language ron used it to open up the chamber of secrets in the last book he may not have known what it meant and it took him a few times  but he did do it 
503,harrypotter,i think taking to cat is called redditortongues
504,harrypotter,what a great question  imagine being able to talk to your dog or cat  jk needs to clear this up  
505,harrypotter,i would imagine so one example  sirius mentioned communicating with crookshanks when he was in dog form so cross magical creature communication was possible i also would think that a legilimens would be able to at least read the emotions or feelings of an animal  even if they do nt have linguistic capabilities 
506,harrypotter,in regard to your comment about being unable to learn parseltongue  i think it is possible to animal languages at least to be understood by those who are not natural speakers  dumbledore himself understands parseltongue   i d think owl language would be the most useful in the wizarding world it s so natural for owls to be seen about  so they d make the perfect observers and spies 
507,harrypotter,we know cats  snakes  frogs  and owls are all magical animals maybe wizards could be born to understand these magical creatures  i ca nt imagine non magical animals have a corresponding magical language 
508,harrypotter,i ve heard there was a parseltongue in gryffindor once 
509,harrypotter,hitching on to this train of thought  would animagi be able to speak the tongue of the animal they can transform into  ie mcgonagall can talk to cats  sirius to dogs  etc  
510,harrypotter,i do nt think those animals are special in the sense that those four wizards could talk to them  that cause and effect is reversed in salazar s case in my opinion   if there are wizards with the innate ability to talk to other animals  there s likely some that are attuned to any animal you can think of 
511,harrypotter,i would say  1  peter pettigrew in gryffindor  peter was the least gryffindor person ever he s basically the biggest coward in the series i do nt know what house he could belong to  but definitely not gryffindor  2  percy weasly in gryffindor percy was a very ambitious person and i think he could belong in slytherin  3  dumbledore in gryffindor  of course dumbledore is a brave man  but i think ravenclaw or slytherin would suit him more yes  slytherin  think about how cunning and manipulative dumbledore could be even if he did nt look like it dumbledore basically lies to everyone in the series and tries to manipulate everyone from harry to snape to voldemort of course it was all for a good cause  but cunning is still cunning and slytherins are not all evil after all also  dumbledore was quite ambitious in his youth with this whole gryndelvald deal  or however his name is spelled  
512,harrypotter,you need to remember that these kids are 11 at the time and measures them at age 11  not what their future selves will be  one badgood experience or interaction in their live could push them any number of different ways  the sorting hat looks for what traits you value  not necessarily what traits you possess  peter pettigrew into gryffindor a prime example  he looked up to and wanted to be brave like james and siruis  the hat made the right call   just because percy is highly ambitious as the time we see him in the books does nt mean that s who he was at 11  he might have looked up to and tried to be like charlie  who was brave  therefore gryffindor was again the right choice 
513,harrypotter,i do nt think the sorting hat puts you in the house you re best suited to but rather what you aspire to be on your points  1  on potter more about the sorting hat it says that peter pettigrew narrowly escaped slytherin when the hat was in him so maybe he asked to be put in gryffindor  not unlike harry  i would argue though that despite being cowardly which led him to betraying james and lily i do think he had some courage he stayed with voldemort for a year he could ve easily abandoned himchopped off his right handkill 13 muggles in the middle of the street and risked getting caught but managed to escapei mean sure they were motivated by cowardice but i would say fear makes you do courageous things and that was what pettigrew did other traits of gryffindor was being courageous and recklessnot just bravery so again despite being pushed by cowardice and self serving  slytherin traits  he still did pretty reckless things  i do know that he is definitely not a hufflepuffnot with his actions of treacheryhufflepuffs are nt the leftover house you got ta be loyal unfortunately peter wasnt  2  i agree with this percy was ambitious enough to get in good with the ministryalthough i do wonder in ootp did percy believe the ministry s lies or did he know it was all fake but did nt care because he wanted to stay in their good books  what do you think   at the end of the deathly hallows he ran away from the ministry to join and fight with his family that could be said to be brave and i think so because he was a pureblood at the time he was protected by his status at the ministry and be still went back to his family but at the same time i do nt think it was brave because i think percy was forced to kish away because they would ve been after him to ask about his family and any sane wizard or witch at the time could realize the ministry was at its all time lowvoldemort low not fudge and umbridge low   3  dumbledore is a tricky one i always thought that with his master chess game he was playing he would ve been the perfect slytherinlol i think dumbledore is wayyyyyy more cunning than voldemort or even slughorn although like in point one i made about pettigrewthe same could be said for dumbledore despite slythering his way through the war he took pretty big risks that relied heavily on chance that s pretty gryffindor to me i think if there was nt a war going on ravenclaw would be his best fit he was a wise old man after all  4  conclusion  i like that the characters were not clean cut caricatures of their houses they re human  the world is nt split into black and white every character in the series could be argued to demonstrate qualities of each of the houses it gives them depth  5  bonus  i think voldemort would ve made a good gryffindor  his actions were even more daring than dumbledore both while he was at school  chamber of secrets fiasco  and when he became the official dark lord ps  its spelled grindelwald
514,harrypotter,i agree with everything you posted i would also add crabbe and goyle in slytherin  they did nt really show ambition at all and they just did what malfoy told them to do  however  i do nt think they fit into any of the houses also zacharias smith has no hufflepuff traits that are shown in the books i think he would ve been better suited for any other house 
515,harrypotter,gt  peter was the least gryffindor person ever he s basically the biggest coward in the series i do nt know what house he could belong to  but definitely not gryffindor  ucavelioness posted this excellent post to why peter in gryffindor was the right choice   he was courageous plenty of times he just did nt have any pride  that is  he did nt mind crying and blubbering and pleading for his life so his words were never courageous  but his actions were almost always physically brave i do nt have the super big list  but here are some of his actions that could be considered brave  stayed friends with remus after he found out he was a werewolf worked to <URL> an animagus without adult guidance the animagus transformation can go horribly  nightmarishly wrong as a rat  ran with three larger animals who could easily have trampled him month after month not to mention there s a shitload of owls around hogwarts  being a rat outside would be very risky  i d say  he was a spy for voldemort for over a year yeah  it s treacherous  but it took some nerve especially once dumbledore suspected a spy do nt forget snape did the same thing the opposite way and for that  harry called snape the bravest man he ever knew  thought fast and ruthlessly and efficiently framed sirius after godric s hollow cut off his own finger without a whimper and coldly massmurdered 12 people  seized his opportunity to escape after the shrieking shack  even though he d been informed that he would be killed if he tried to transform he waited for the right moment and took a gamble with his life  and it paid off  he argues with voldemort when he does nt agree with a plan  and the plan in gof was pretty convoluted and bloated  he speaks up even though he s afraid only gryffindor death eater  only death eater we see do this coincidence  the man cuts off his own hand voldemort was nt forcing him  he was already in the cauldron peter does this alone and of his own violation  he reminds voldemort of his promise after voldemort was reborn  he did nt really need peter any more and could have killed him  and peter knows this  but he still manages a reproachful  you promised   seriously  no one else treats the dark lord anything like this 
516,harrypotter,the two that stick out to me are dumbledore and hagrid  jk does have a tendency especially in the earlier books to put all the good guys in gryffindor  the bad guys in slytherin  and filler characters in the other houses she tries to redeem this later in the series with characters like luna and tonks but she ca nt change what she had already published  dumbledore and hagrid serve as two sides of the  fatherfigure  for harry at hogwarts  so it would make sense that they were in the the same house as him we also find out their house affiliations in the first two books  where the gryffindorslytherin dichotomy is at its most obvious  both have many gryffindor traits hagrid shows his bravery in situations of crisis like when he s arrested in cos and fights off the ministry officials in ootp but i ve always thought that hagrid would make an excellent hufflepuff he s unassuming and loyal to a fault to the people in his life  especially harry and dumbledore   he s a hard worker  seeing as he has been groundskeeper forever and takes on a teaching position on top of that he has an affinity for magical creatures and the outdoors like many hufflepuffs  although his cooking skills are nt quite up to helga s standards   yes there are moments when he is unpuff  like showing harry the dragons   importantly hufflepuff corresponds with the earth element  and you wo nt find an earthier guy than hagrid he s kind to a fault to students  unless they re mean to him   and often has students to his hut when they re lonely or down  dumbledore has gotten way more discussion in this thread  so i ll say less about him he could ve been a great slytherin or ravenclaw since a lot of people have made the slytherin argument  i ll make the ravenclaw one he s one of the most brilliant wizards to ever come out of hogwarts they talk about him wowing professors with theory when he is a student and it looks like he does a fair bit of independent research while at school he s also a total oddball and those types thrive in ravenclaw he has an insatiable desire for knowledge as well
517,harrypotter,maybe peter pettigrew would have embraced his inner bravery if he was nt hanging out with james  sirius and remus maybe those 3 looking after him and protecting him all the time  actually made him a bigger coward than he was  because he never got the opportunity to stand up for himself he got so used to them being for him each and every time that he never realized that is not how life is supposed to work this naturally makes him think of saving his own skin than his friends  and makes succumb to voldemort s power who knows  if neville had hung out with the golden trio all the damn time  then he might have never stood up for himself either a little independence will go a long way in building one s courage 
518,harrypotter,the sorting hat tries to put you where you can find your equals  the hat also knows all the students of each house  so it might take this in consideration harry disliked malfoy from the start  the hat probably saw this  it also knew that sirius and james had already met in the hogwarts train and so on you think voldemort would have turned out good and kind just because he was put in hufflepuff  no  but the slytherin house were the one in which he found his equals  people of ambition and that shared his ideals  so there is no solid answer  sometimes it puts you in a house to balance your traits  hermione was very clever  but gryffindor balanced her somewhat  she certainly did things that she would not have done in ravenclaw malfoy was put into slytherin because he wanted to  he had the traits and etc  if the hat wanted to simply  balance  his personality  then it should have put him in gryffindor for example neville wanted to go to hufflepuff  but the hat insisted and chose gryffindor instead 
519,harrypotter,dumbledore being in slytherin would be a great twist and excellent way of saying  see  there are good people in slytherin  
520,harrypotter,i think that when it comes to where the sorting hat places you  it ultimately comes down to who you are aspiring to be in that moment think about when harry was sorted if it had been completely up to the sorting hat  harry would have been placed in slytherin just as harry told his son at the end of book 7  the hat goes with your choice above all other aspects it weighs in so whoever your 11yearold self believes he or she is or should be  that is where the hat sorts you another good example is the sorting hat s placement of malfoy i love how it is demonstrated in the movie  the hat barely touches malfoy s head and he is immediately sent to slytherin this is because he has been raised by a family bursting with pureblood and slytherin pride  and this is who he aspires to be as well  i hope this make sense  but in the end  i really believe that the sorting hat does nt choose the house for you  you choose the house for you 
521,harrypotter,seems like the sorting hat has a pretty clear algorithm  1  you a dick  yes  slytherin  no  2  you brave  yes  gryffindor  no  3  you smart  yes  ravenclaw  no  hufflepuff  case studies  malfoy dick  yup does nt matter that he s smart  he fixed the vanishing cabinet  props for that   hermione dick  nope brave  yup does nt matter that she s brilliant  she gets gryffindor   harry dick  apparently enough to confuse the hat  but borderline brave  alright  gryffindor  counterpoints  cedric seems not a dick  brave and smart  which would put him in gryffindor  so to answer your question  cedric obvious algorithm malfunction 
522,harrypotter,it looks so real 
523,harrypotter,buzzfeed article  here     <URL>  ci3obbgxol 
524,harrypotter,it looks like so much fun 
525,harrypotter,the photographer is a friend of mine and these pictures were shot at  kalap trust     wwwkalaptrustorg   india featuring kids in the region having some fun in the hills 
526,harrypotter,holy hippogriffs  this is awesome  d  
527,harrypotter,what country and continent do you think it will be located  is there any information regarding ilvermony s location per jkr 
528,harrypotter,footnotes  maybe interjected might get distracting  borderline fan fic lol
529,harrypotter,it s a wozard pirate map to hidden treasure 
530,harrypotter,i m sure you ve all seen the posts on here or on tumblr about how sad it is that there will be more lupins and potters at hogwarts  but no more blacks well  according to  the black family tree     wwwhplexiconorgimagesblackfamilytreesofficialfinalversiongif  there are 3 different blacks that could theoretically have descendants at hogwarts sirius had an uncle that was disowned for giving him money when he ran away  a greatuncle who was a squib and a greatgreatuncle disowned for caring about muggle rights it is entirely possible and even likely that at least one of these gentleman have descendants who could attend hogwarts given that all of these gentleman were disowned it is even possible that they would be blacks more after sirius s heart than his mother s just something i thought people ought to know
531,harrypotter,it would be so perfect and so ironic that those who are disowned from the family would be the ones to carry on the family name the blacks tried so hard to be the pictureperfect wizarding family that they forced their family to <URL> what embarrassed them the most 
532,harrypotter,not to mention the weasleys  potters  and longbottoms listed in there they were women marrying men but one or more of their children could take  or be given  the family name black just to keep it going it s not totally improbable  edit  cleaned up a bit
533,harrypotter,ha  i never thought of that nice 
534,harrypotter,there are a number of pure blood lines that end in the book  crouch  dumbledore says in gof it was the end of that line  dumbledore crabbe  with vincent dying and his dad in azkaban  lestrange also a bunch of the death eaters do nt seem to have living relatives  avery  mulciber  macnair etc 
535,harrypotter,the only thing wrong with that tree is that andromeda black married ted tonks who was muggle  born   not a muggle 
536,harrypotter,to me this isnt a big deal sirius was like the good apple in a tree of rotten ones being sad thats theres no more blacks is like being sad the hitler family ended when bill hitler was an animal rights activist dont get me wrong hitlers the hitlers are horrible but dont be sad that a racist family tree is ended be sad that good guy died
537,harrypotter,i could be totally off base  but my first thought was the quibbler article luna was reading on the train when harry first meets her if you turn it upside down the runes <URL> a spell that will turn your enemies ears into kumquats 
538,harrypotter,in the book it s the password to get in as he s sleeping in the corridor when harry and the others go for the midnight duel 
539,harrypotter,map of the muggle underground   edit  spelling
540,harrypotter,what  if any  new subjects do you think hogwarts would offer today 
541,harrypotter,politics a look at the way the ministry of magic is run as well as various governments from around the world  both magical and muggle   considering the ministry is such a huge employer and that may students enter the ministry upon leaving hogwarts it seems prudent to give students a detailed understanding of how the government works this would be a newt level course  muggle studies not a new subject but a change in the way it would be taught from 12 year all students who grew up in a magical household  regardless of whether they are pureblood or muggleborn or whatever  would take this class it would teach them the very basics of muggle life how they live etc in third year  you can continue this subject and it would carry one much like it does in the books at newt level is get s much more theoretical and questions mugglemagical relations and things  magical studies the counterpart to muggle studies  this time for students who grew up in a muggle household  regardless of parentage   this would help students get a better understanding of the wizarding world  how laws are created  wizarding pastimes and things that most people who grew up in a magical household  would take for granted the course ends at the end of the second year however it s not very often  once a week or once every two weeks at max  literature taken at third year literature helps students get a very basic understanding of the written language both from a magical and a muggle perspective can be taken at newt level  introduction to healing basic healing subject taken at newt level does exactly what it say s on the tin  magical theory newt level in depth look at magical theory why spells do a certain thing  how language effects spells  how spells are created  aside from these i believe professor binns would have been sacked or at least  a history of magic professor hired to actually do a decent job and teach the students in an engaging way binns will teach to an empty classroom he wo nt mind or notice 
542,harrypotter,maybe some language courses  like gobbledegook for example 
543,harrypotter,something related to magic items  how to identify it  create  improve its quality  etc early years it could be the basic stuff  like simply enchanting something  shield hats  glasses which enhance your vision  etc   and the advanced methods  would include the creation of magic effects that will last even after the creator dies  so its much more complicated in my opinion this would be very nice  the magic world would certainly advance  there would be faster brooms  floating shoes  clothes which can adapt to the owners size  hats that improve your concentration  etc  fred and george made a ton of money inventing stuff like this  so this is not very common and its probably not easy  they told harry that he would nt believe how many witches and wizards out there cant produce a proper shield charm  and they were mostly ministry workers  and its required top grades to work there 
544,harrypotter,basic healing
545,harrypotter,english maths physical education  playing sports 
546,harrypotter,really  really nice work 
547,harrypotter,i think snape was jealous of james  but not really for the reasons that most people think especially lupin here snape does hate that james is popular   big quidditch hero   but also does nt value athleticism   i d rather be brainy than brawny    he s more madjealous that society values these things over things he values that james and sirius were handed everything in life looks  money  popularity  and his intelligence and hard work despite coming from poverty means nothing 
548,harrypotter,i think lupin s right to look for a reasoning beyond lily i thought snape and james had a problem with each other long before lily became an issue jameslily might have made it worse  but it was nt the source of their problem   plus  if lupin had any suspicions about snapelily  i doubt he d voice it in front of harry 
549,harrypotter,i m going to make a lot of assumptions here so please bare with me  being in the order would bring about a lot of intimate information lupin was nt a person to blab what he knows and frankly who would he have talked to with sirius in prison  after lily s death snape would ve been inconsolable who knows how he reacted  probably withdrawing  and maybe even slipping up in front of members of the order because only they would be showing any emotion about the potters  remus is kind  compassionate  caring  and introspective perhaps these qualities couple with a few scraps of information from dumbledore or another member of the order and the out of character  overreaction  by snape  which by most people s standard would be controlled  but for a fellow introvert these signs could be a bit more obvious  of course if remus knows or caught wind that snape s patronus changed and bang  we get that odd sentence structure in the quote  retread it this time with the knowledge that remus is keeping the information guarded either for harry or even snap s sake it s an odd place to pause and he mentions  thinking  as in hypothesizing and using  anyway  as a throw away to move the subject along without dwelling i believe he s just giving a plausible story with partial truth but he knows the truth and is just being a good person and sparing two people a lot of pain and confusion 
550,harrypotter,looks like runes on the top and bottom of the page it could also be a ward  or a curse that has been revealed by some other sort of magic call up bill weasley he used to be a curse breaker 
551,harrypotter,hi  i got some questions i want to ask about the films i ve never read the books  but i plan to   and i guessed this would be the best place to ask them i m also on mobile so please tell me if the formatting is dodgy  first one is why was nt harry angry at dumbledore after harry died   he saw snape s memory of dumbledore manipulating harry into  raising him as pig to slaughter  yet when he saw him he did nt seem too bothered  in fact he looked like he still admired him  another question is what do you think harry thinks of his father after seeing snape s memory of him  cause to me it looked like he was a bully and stole lilly from him was there something that snape did that gave james the right to do that to him  or was it snape s hate for james that literally changed his memory  where did harry get the mirror shard and where did the mirror even come from  i ve looked through the films and there s no mention of it but then in the deathly hallows harry suddenly has it with no explanation  one more  what is the significance of snape s patronus  i know he loved lilly  but when dumbledore just randomly mentions lilly when he casts the doe  it s not really clear what he means  does he just ask if he loved her  would make sense after snape s  always   thanks guys i do love this subreddit  harry potter is pretty much my favourite film series as i grew up as the same age as harry and the lot  definitely an experience that i loved but did nt know was happening at the time 
552,harrypotter,this is the problem with watching the movies first     read the books asap the movies are fun entertainment but you wo nt get nearly as much out of them as you will out of the books i hope you get to soon and you re enjoying your hp journey  i can try to answer some of your questions  in the books harry goes through some more emotions about dumbledore having known he would need to die ultimately i think he comes out still admiring dumbledore because he knew how hard it was for him and that this was the only choice also  he was going through so many emotions about his own life that being mad at someone else was nt at the top of his mind  i think the jamessnape thing is very much up for debate i ve heard a lot of insightful things on this sub though  the mirror was from sirius he gave it to him as a gift there are two that are connected  the idea being sirius had one and harry had one and they would be able to talk through them   someone correct me if i m wrong but i think aberforth gets the other one after it was stolen from grimmauld place by mundungus  lily is represented by a doe this makes sense because she and james were together and his animagus  and probably patronus  was a stag the patronus is important because it is much stronger evidence that he still loves lily than just saying he does they talk about how only something really powerful emotionally can change a person s patronus  hope this helps other people help me out if i ve missed stuff i m sure i ve messed up a lot of spelling  sorry about that 
553,harrypotter,all of these questions are answered by the books  and some answered might be a little spoilery for some aspects that the movies never went into if you d rather not have any further spoilers  please stop reading here  a this is complicated and is actually a long overarcing thread in the last book through out the book  harry  at many points  feels very frustrated with dumbledore and the amount of secrets he kept from harry however he also comes to see that mostly when dumbledore was keeping secrets  it was as a benefit to harry it might not be something harry liked  but it was something he needed eventually  harry makes a decision to trust in dumbledore s judgement and sort of comes to accept that he can not always know everything and that sometimes he needs to not act  which is enormously hard for him   when he sees those memories  he does think about dumbledore s betrayal  but it feels to him as a minor thing against the knowledge that he has to die  gt  slowly  very slowly  he sat up  and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was  brain and nerve and bounding heart  it would all be gone    or at least  he would be gone from it his breath came slow and deep  and his mouth and throat were completely dry  but so were his eyes  gt  dumbledore  s betrayal was almost nothing of course there had been a bigger plan  harry had simply been too foolish to see it  he realized that now  the thing is that harry does see the sense of it he understands why dumbledore did what he did  and he understands why he is the one who has to die  and if it is him  then nobody else has to at this point  harry s emotions are a huge mess he is in a great state of shock and wanting to live but knowing he can not  so anger is not at the forefront of his brain eventually when he meets dumbledore  after being killed  by voldemort  the shock has worn off  but he is still mostly confused  which keeps him from feeling anger it also helps that pretty much one of the first things dumbledore tells him is that he is not exactly dead then dumbledore goes on to explain and apologises to harry  with tears in his eyes  which helps harry understand that everything dumbledore did  he did nt do for the funsies he made these decisions because they were the best ones  but they were nt easy or kind  not even on dumbledore himself  which is what helps harry come to peace with them  honestly  the books go way more in depth with harry s feelings re  dumbledore than anyone could ever do in a simple post  so i very much urge you to read them it will help clarify a lot  b when harry first finds out about the bully james was in the past  it actually bothers him a lot there is quite a chunk of the fifth book that deals with harry thinking about what he saw in the pensive and his father s behaviour he does quite a dangerous thing  using umbridge s fire to talk to sirius and lupin  just to get more information on his father s behaviour eventually he learns to give it a place he still loves his father  obviously  but he thinks of him with slightly less blind idealism still  from all accounts  it does seem like james  honestly  changed  and snape was nt exactly innocent in all of it either  james and snape pretty much continuously hexed each other  so it is not like james is an unrepenting douchebag either he s a person who made douchy choices as a teen  but also made a lot of good ones during that same time of his life  who eventually grew out of it  which is sort of how harry comes to remember him  c in the order of the phoenix  after christmas  sirius gives harry one of a pair of twoway mirrors but does nt explain them they are basically like mirror walkietalkies  that sirius and james used to use to talk to each other in detention harry  realising it is a way to contact sirius  fears that doing so will make sirius do something stupid and dangerous and puts them in the bottom of his trunk he forgets about them  even when he needs them most after sirius s death  harry remembers the mirror  however because sirius is dead  he can not use them anymore still  he does nt get rid of it it eventually shatters  but harry keeps the biggest piece the second mirror  the one that belonged to sirius is found by mundungus when he is looting sirius s house for stuff to sell he sells that mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother  who realises what is aberforth uses the mirror to keep an eye on harry  it is his blue eye harry sees  and eventually uses it to send dobby to them when they are in great danger  d snape loved lily snape has never loved anyone but lily lily cared great for him  as a friend  and potentially more according to jkr  but the path snape put himself on  the one with the dark arts  turned her away from him it all came to a head when snape called her a mudblood lily ended their friendship there  but snape did nt stop loving her because he loved her  he tried to ask voldemort to spare her  and through that  gave lily an out  which she refused to take but instead protected her son   knowing that snape loved lily so much  dumbledore used that love to get snape on their side when dumbledore asks if snape s feeling are still the same after all this time  snape casts that patronus  lily s patronus had been a doe as well  and tell him  yes  always he s still in this for lily 
554,harrypotter,1  i totally forget how harry reacts after he sees the memories i think maybe he just sits down and cries for a bit  it was a lot to take in  2  snape kicks harry out of the dungeons after that lesson iirc  harry basically runs out of the dungeons and ends up on some stairs feeling nauseous about how he just saw his father behave  25  sirius and james had started to bully snape on the hogwarts express before they had even gotten sorted yet both james and sirius came from money and gave snape crap for wanting to be in slytherin house  like his mother eileen was   so  snape did not instigate the bullying by fifth year  snape was very much into the dark arts and was hanging around shady people and james was about to stop being such an arse all the time from snape s point of view  james stole her from lily s point of view  snape had <URL> toxic and james was a changed man calling her a mudblood was the last straw and she cut snape out of her life and james and her clicked and they started dating  snape s memory did nt change what james didwas james grew up and matured  3  in order of the phoenix   at 12 grimmauld during the christmas holidays i think   sirius gives harry a package and tells him if he ever should need to be in contact  to use what s in the package harry has just seen a spat between snape and sirius and does not want to be the reason sirius ends up getting killed so  harry never opens the package  which contained the mirror shard he  does  open the package  after  sirius has died and feels like an idiot for not having opened it sooner mundungus feltcher ends up stealing stuff from grimmauld place after sirius dies he ends up selling the other half of the mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother who owns the hog s head tavern   so  when harry keeps seeing bright blue eyes in the mirror during deathly hallows  it s actually aberforth keeping a watchful eye on harry in case he needs help  4  dumbledore had just asked snape if he had grown to care about harry snape casts his patronus it s a doe just like lily s patronus was a doe dumbledore realizes that snape is still fighting for lily  lily after all this time   snape replies  always   in that snape had always loved lily in that he never stopped  or will stop  loving her 
555,harrypotter,in the new ebooks  at least the ones i got from ibooks  they do exactly this it s not very often  but there will be a little quill button after a sentence you can tap for more information i d say there s maybe 56 to a book though  i would love to see more of these added bonus  the illustrations move slightly as well 
556,harrypotter,it s been nearly a decade guys  i want to line up for something please 
557,harrypotter,i hope so cause i really wan na go to one 
558,harrypotter,yes  it just depends on where i ve seen multiple people online say their local bookstores are planning midnight release parties already maybe check with a local bookstore and let them know you re interested and they might announce something 
559,harrypotter,i ve wondered about the portraits too i did nt think about it exactly as rules but  1 are the portraits given a copy of the memories of the person they represent  i would have thought so  but the other post by macabregoblin here and the mentioned wiki seem to say no  2 do the portraits have the personality of the subject  i think the answer to this is yes otherwise the portraits are pointless right  the only connection to the subject would be the way they look  3 are the portraits intelligent  can they solve problems  i think so it seems they should be able to pass a turing test    enwikipediaorgwikituring_test  4 are the portraits conscious  are they  living   and would it be a crime similar to murder to destroy one  this is another artificial intelligence type of question  like is it moral to kill commander data from star trek portraits are fun in fanfiction there is a popular postdeathly hallows fan fiction where there was a portrait of fred weasley that george brought to fred s funeral that would be creepy there is another one where harry s grandparents  portraits are in his vaults and he has long conversations with them both are good fics  sorry i ca nt remember what they were called 
560,harrypotter,oh my god i did nt ever figure that out oo
561,harrypotter,or summon the objects in the room after the fiendfyre  or summon the room with the fiendfyre gone  the nature of the fiendfyre is magic and presumably while it can destroy magical objects  i m under the impression that one could transfigure ashes of a former object back into itself so that leaves my question  is it possible for the room of requirement to restore all the objects in the room of hidden things  minus any enchantments cast upon the objects  which i presume is nullified after being burned   additional questions   does the room of requirement  being of its own magic  have its own protections which the fiendfyre would nt affect   does the room of requirement  being that it can be multiple rooms  still exist despite the fiendfyre in the version of the room of requirement that is the room of hidden things  also  if the room of requirement still exists  does that mean the room of hidden things just the only thing destroyed   is the nature of the room of requirement an everlasting spell  meaning that as a type of magic and not a object  the fiendfyre would nt be able to destroy it   does the room of requirement have its own magic   why did nt the fiendfyre escape the room of requirement 
562,harrypotter,honestly i was always under the assumption that the ror itself was destroyed with the fiendfyre its really interesting to consider the alternative that  just  the room of hidden things was destroyed 
563,harrypotter,my thoughts are  that magical destruction is final much like avada kedavera once it s goneit s gone  i m not sure what precedent is set for returning magical artifacts from ashes  other than obviously a phoenix  so it really boils down too is the ror more magical than magical destruction  i believe no  however the ror could conjure a fairly detailed replication of the original item if it was wellneeded the original however would be destroyed 
564,harrypotter,i assume no  because the items were destroyed by magic it was nt normal fire  it was magical fire kind of like how george s ear ca nt be healed because it was magically cursed off 
565,harrypotter,the room of requirement ca nt summon any objects from the room of hidden things because its purpose of keeping things hiddenwhen hermione tries to summon the diadem in deathly hallows it didnt work now you could say that maybe  as a headcanon  that voldemort put an enchantment on the tiara so it ca nt be summonedbut that ca nt be true because voldemort did nt think that anyone would know about the room so what was the point  i do nt know what happened to the room of requirement after the fiendfyre ate all the objectsnothing in the books says anything about it afterward also the transfiguration part would require you to know what the object was before it burned to ashes so i do nt think they can as for summoning the objects  requesting the ror  back from the asheswe really do nt know the limits of the room s magic also fiendfyre is very dark magic so i do nt think it s likely the room can bring it back 
566,harrypotter,for context  my university offers a program of studentfacilitated classes  which includes a class on harry potter  yes  you do get units   for our end of the year project  a girl in my class made these tarot cards  and i thought they were too beautiful not to share she made seven  but i only got to take pictures of two and one of the back of the cards they were all amazing and i wish she sold them 
567,harrypotter,that s really awesome       youtubenl6cdfn2i3i  i would have loved that as my hall in college 
568,harrypotter,i love it   
569,harrypotter,you are the type of ra i hope i can be if i manage to get selected  my current ras are great guys  but they did a great gatsby theme instead of harry potter 
570,harrypotter,that s so excellent  i would be so pleased to find this on my first day great job 
571,harrypotter,this was my bulletin board for the month too  p   <URL>
572,harrypotter,you look really cool  how did you make this  and how long did it take you 
573,harrypotter,a real artificial eye you say  those are opposites  mind you  however  i love your tribute to my mentor  
574,harrypotter,i love that you may homage to the books and have the magical eye on the right  not the left like the movies changed it to  for some reason 
575,harrypotter,hey madeye  i found  this     <URL>  by the rose bushes  do you know what it is 
576,harrypotter,my friend and i do a podcast twice a week in which we review original music from the internet for one of our episodes this week i was thinking we d talk about wizard rock  we re aware of draco and the malfoys are there any other groups that are nt terrible 
577,harrypotter,oliver boyd and the remembralls
578,harrypotter,  values values values values values not traits   i do nt understand why people do nt get this the hat sorts you based on what you value  not your traits the world is nt black and white you re not going to get sorted into a house based on a single trait hermione did nt deserve to get put in ravenclaw just because she was smart she valued bravery and loyalty that s why she was in gryffindor  snape had no ambition  what  one of his main goals was being apart of something big  and he was he helped take down one of the biggest dark wizards of all time no ambition  the dude had invented new spells by the time he was 15 he improved on standard potions  created and published by experts  and made them better before he even finished puberty no ambition  what  he   valued   ambition part of the reason he criticized harry so much  along with james  was because he saw no ambition in him he felt like harry got everything handed to him  i m not saying whether i agree or not  just what snape felt   instead of working hard to achieve his goals  unlike snape himself again  he   valued   ambition  pettigrew   valued   bravery that s why he hung out with james  sirius  and lupin he idolized them he wanted to be like them he followed them around everywhere he even became an animagus for them  even though he almost did nt make it but in the end  he did nt have the guts to be brave himself but how the hell was the hat supposed to know that  it ca nt tell the future it did nt know he would betray his best friends  again  the world is nt black and white you re not going to be placed in ravenclaw just because you re  smart   there are plenty of smart people in other houses you re not going to be placed in slytherin just because you re  ambitious   there are plenty of ambitious people in other houses you get placed in a house based on what you value deep inside whether you follow through fulfilling these values yourself is nt for the hat to decide  it s for you the hat is not a fortune teller 
579,harrypotter,a gryffindor  maybe  i m not sure  he s not really brave  he s does nt care about knowledge  he s not a hard worker and he s not cunning  but he may be a gryff because he wants to be praised and desires glory 
580,harrypotter,i d send a house elf to do it no spells necessary 
581,harrypotter,i have already read all of the potter books multiple times  but it s been a few years and i was looking to do so again as a frequent member of book clubs  i thought it could be enjoyable to find someone to read along with this seemed a good place to find someone for that   so if you like the idea and would nt mind taking the journey with a 37yearold fella  send me a message or write on kik to iamhereiguess
582,harrypotter,i just commented on another post earlier that i ve been itching to read them again i d be happy to read along with ya  you never know what unanswered questions you may still have or maybe catch something you ve never noticed before until you read with someone else  
583,harrypotter,you could always join us over at rdueling for harry potter trivia 
584,harrypotter,i would be interested i ve reread them many many times but would be happy to again 
585,harrypotter,would nt it be crazy if he and harry ended up in the same house  i think it would be gryffindor  to be honest 
586,harrypotter,my husband s funny valentine  
587,harrypotter,i bet a  box of chocolate cauldrons     <URL>   would make your night special   so if anyone wants to take a piece of chocolate to try and get  a date tonight    let me know that you want one     <URL>   remember  the longer you let them sit  the stronger they are  
588,harrypotter,voldy ca nt love it must ve been from someone else
589,harrypotter,james and lily did nt start dating til their 7th year snape s hatred of james was beyond lily when james and lily got together  that was just another straw on the camel s back  james and snape were mutual rivals no matter what the constantly fought each other they were just polar opposites snape hated james because of his attitude and popularity  and james hated snape because of his love of the dark arts and the sketchy people that snape ran around with 
590,harrypotter,i want him to do it with me 
591,harrypotter,this shit really angers me there s good and bad in all houses snape is a fucking slytherin 
592,harrypotter,that s so excellent  i would be so pleased to find this on my first day great job 
593,harrypotter,this is so cute  i wish my ta was into harry potter our theme was not nearly as cool you should add hermione s spew hats and socks for the unsuspecting elves to the gryffindor area  
594,harrypotter,i ve always wondered this critically  it did nt seem to be as well received as the other books and apart from a couple of the camping chapters  i m not really sure why could someone who did nt think the book was satisfactory elaborate as to why it disappointed 
595,harrypotter,it was disappointing to me for three reasons  1 most of my favorite characters died  2 an awful lot of the book felt disjointed and aimless to me  including the wandering around in the woods for weeks  3 this may be an unpopular opinion  but it s always bothered me that harry did nt actually die i felt like the whole whoops jk not dead  thing was a copout  and it cheapened the story for me i felt like that was the natural point to which the story was building 
596,harrypotter,you need to remember that these kids are 11 at the time and measures them at age 11  not what their future selves will be  one badgood experience or interaction in their live could push them any number of different ways  the sorting hat looks for what traits you value  not necessarily what traits you possess  peter pettigrew into gryffindor a prime example  he looked up to and wanted to be brave like james and siruis  the hat made the right call   just because percy is highly ambitious as the time we see him in the books does nt mean that s who he was at 11  he might have looked up to and tried to be like charlie  who was brave  therefore gryffindor was again the right choice 
597,harrypotter,very cool also  i giggled a bit at  real artificial eye  because it sounds like an oxymoron 
598,harrypotter,i imagine the sorting hat also considers the benefits of having a more or less equal number of students sorted into each house  or considers the houses  current capacity to accept new students in terms of dorms  teachertostudent ratios  etc 
599,harrypotter,it s a moviething  and it s wrong he can not perform magic at the dursley household before he s 17 even magic performed around him when no adult wizardwitch is supposed to be nearby can get him into trouble that s how he gets a warning when dobby does the magic in cos that s the law dealing with underage magic muggles seeing it is a separate law that deals with breaking magical secrecy  in ootp  harry casts a patronus in little whingings and is charged with breaking 2 laws 
600,harrypotter,do you think that these characters knew the readers could  see  what they were doing and sometimes even read their thoughts  the very thought of this has blown my mind   
601,harrypotter,you ve had too much dragon dust 
602,harrypotter,muggles privy to the wizarding world via a book series  the ministry would be all over that 
603,harrypotter,someone s got  neverending story  in their brain   
604,harrypotter,unless hogwarts employed professor wade wilson  probably not 
605,harrypotter,i bet it has 394 calories 
606,harrypotter, detention  as well  mr stebbins     <URL> 
607,harrypotter,what 
608,harrypotter,too bad it was nt a gryffindor   say  stebbins  how do you feel about lions   rawr  
609,harrypotter,usnogkingstebbins do nt care  just like the honey badger  now  molly had just poured me a cup of t  e     <URL>  abut where did i put it  i suspect those fine nargles xeno lovegood is always on about 
610,harrypotter,hell  bro i would nt be mad fawcett s hot  
611,harrypotter,just like 20 dollars is 20 dollars  10 points is 10 points ya feel 
612,harrypotter,hahaha   yeah i bet that was awkward   of course  i would nt know   but i hope you enjoyed it  and i m sure you earned those points back by being really awesome since you are a hufflepuff  
613,harrypotter,and here i am i ca nt even color a coloring book 
614,harrypotter,really  really nice work 
615,harrypotter,snep crepe
616,harrypotter,as a resident of somerville on the other side of the charles from brookline  i know what i want for breakfast today
617,harrypotter,god  i keep forgetting we lost him and it hurts my heart every time 
618,harrypotter,wow
619,harrypotter,you sunk my battleship 
620,harrypotter,to be fair  they all forgot their robes starting around movie  3 
621,harrypotter,i always thought she was named after hermes because she is a messenger for the underrepresented like with spew 
622,harrypotter,pettigrew he s just a massive  slimy coward 
623,harrypotter,i would definitely buy this  no questions asked 
624,harrypotter,lol  i have to say the character portrayal in the movies is good  too too good  in fact that i still hate the actress when i watched maleficient and saw her as one of the faeries 
625,harrypotter,wormtail of course  because he is a coward and the kind of person that is mean to his friends because they threat you well  but they never say anything to somebody that will hurt them so its easy for him to betray his friends and leave his own mother to go and live as a rat  because he knew that the good people would nt kill him  but voldemort s supporters would 
626,harrypotter,i believe that parseltoungue is not exactly a learned of a learned language like english  mermish  or gobbledygook it is almost like a magical language that has an effect similar to the pseudolatin that is used for spells meaning that it carries magical effects i am basing this mostly on the basilisk in the chamber of secrets horcrux riddle tells harry that parseltongue wo nt help him stave off the king of serpents it does nt seem to make sense that one person that can control a snake with speech would be inherently better than another with the same ability  unless perhaps the magic behind it was stronger the chamber of secrets door  the bathroom sink  and the locket both seem to answer to the same series of hisses as far as we know  all salazar did was use a colloportus spell on it using parseltongue the counter charm would also have to be in parseltongue  because salazar did nt want anyone but the heir of slytherin to be able to enter following this chain of logic we have to assume that if salazar  whom arguably was the second smartest founder and the most cunning  was certain that parseltongue was only an inherited magical trait thus maintaining that only his descendants could continue his quest to be a radical racists err purists the inherited magical traits thought is supported by tonks and her explanation that metamorphmagus are born  and not made as explained later  arthur discovers some random selling metamorphmagus medals that do nt work this could explain that though metamorphmagus ca nt me made they can at least in theory be copied which will round up this long winded explanation of mine dumbledore  and ron could not speak parseltongue in my interpretation they can only copy it  or at least contextually analyze it ron could open the door because he had recently heard harry say the parselmouth equivalent of alohomora he roughly knew what to expect would happen by speaking it  much like harry knowing sectumsempra was for enemies dumbledore understood it because he was smart as hell and could interpret what was going on in the gaunt memories by morfins actions after marvolo spoke to him  tldr  dumbledore and ron ca nt speak parselmouth  at best they can copy or deduce what was being said you need to be a direct descendant of slytherin  or at lease a horcrux of one 
627,harrypotter,wow  really cool  nice work 
628,harrypotter,i do nt think those animals are special in the sense that those four wizards could talk to them  that cause and effect is reversed in salazar s case in my opinion   if there are wizards with the innate ability to talk to other animals  there s likely some that are attuned to any animal you can think of 
629,harrypotter,sigh i wish more people would embrace moral relativism a bigot is a bigot is so absurdly stringent and vilifies nearly everyone in history perspective  matters  
630,harrypotter,you would think that  in a magical universe where certain people can talk to certain animals  that you would see comparable examples across the board talking to birds  cats  what have you i would assume that they probably exist  but are nt viewed as inherently sinister like a parseltongue probably just as rare  though 
631,harrypotter,i always thought it was because nothing makes her happier than terrorizing nonpure bloods  and that is the happiness feeding her patronus
632,harrypotter,harry explains it directly in the text  gt  the moment he had passed the place where the patronus cat patrolled  he felt the change in temperature  it was warn and comfortable here the patronus  he was sure  was umbridge s  and it glowed brightly because she was so happy here  in her element  upholding the twisted laws she had helped to write  dh  us   p259 a patronus requires a happy memory  not a pure heart voldemort may not be able to produce one  but umbridge is twisted enough to fully believe she s in the right without even a trace of doubt about her own motives or methods 
633,harrypotter,well fuck
634,harrypotter,there are a number of pure blood lines that end in the book  crouch  dumbledore says in gof it was the end of that line  dumbledore crabbe  with vincent dying and his dad in azkaban  lestrange also a bunch of the death eaters do nt seem to have living relatives  avery  mulciber  macnair etc 
635,harrypotter,i just commented on another post earlier that i ve been itching to read them again i d be happy to read along with ya  you never know what unanswered questions you may still have or maybe catch something you ve never noticed before until you read with someone else  
636,harrypotter,i m sure you ve all seen the posts on here or on tumblr about how sad it is that there will be more lupins and potters at hogwarts  but no more blacks well  according to  the black family tree     wwwhplexiconorgimagesblackfamilytreesofficialfinalversiongif  there are 3 different blacks that could theoretically have descendants at hogwarts sirius had an uncle that was disowned for giving him money when he ran away  a greatuncle who was a squib and a greatgreatuncle disowned for caring about muggle rights it is entirely possible and even likely that at least one of these gentleman have descendants who could attend hogwarts given that all of these gentleman were disowned it is even possible that they would be blacks more after sirius s heart than his mother s just something i thought people ought to know
637,harrypotter,weasley s are no longer pureblood ginny married harry  so their children have muggle greatgrandparents meanwhile ron married hermione  so their children have muggle grandparents 
638,harrypotter,i have moderate hp knowledge  but i d really like to make it special since she s a really big fan 
639,harrypotter,looks like a millicent bulstrode if i ever saw one 
640,harrypotter,prob had an invite your brothersister to work day
641,harrypotter,maybe it was goyle s twin sister  the movies deviated from the books alot so you never know 
642,harrypotter,the top comment in this  thread     <URL>  suggests that parseltongues could be magically attenuated to speaking to snakes  however elsewhere on this reddit and i believe jkr herself said it can not be learned we know genetics  of sorts  plays into it some  so are there natural felinetongues  aviriatoungues  rodentiatongues that we do nt know about out there  of course i m asking for wild speculation here as the canon does nt talk about it much and seems to keep parseltongues on par with voldy so no character wants to explore it in the books for fear of being named a deatheater or whatever irrational nonsense comes to mind 
643,harrypotter, felinetongues  filch  ms figg   just kidding  althought it would be awesome 
644,harrypotter,i think parseltongue can be a learned language ron used it to open up the chamber of secrets in the last book he may not have known what it meant and it took him a few times  but he did do it 
645,harrypotter,i think taking to cat is called redditortongues
646,harrypotter,what a great question  imagine being able to talk to your dog or cat  jk needs to clear this up  
647,harrypotter,i would imagine so one example  sirius mentioned communicating with crookshanks when he was in dog form so cross magical creature communication was possible i also would think that a legilimens would be able to at least read the emotions or feelings of an animal  even if they do nt have linguistic capabilities 
648,harrypotter,in regard to your comment about being unable to learn parseltongue  i think it is possible to animal languages at least to be understood by those who are not natural speakers  dumbledore himself understands parseltongue   i d think owl language would be the most useful in the wizarding world it s so natural for owls to be seen about  so they d make the perfect observers and spies 
649,harrypotter,we know cats  snakes  frogs  and owls are all magical animals maybe wizards could be born to understand these magical creatures  i ca nt imagine non magical animals have a corresponding magical language 
650,harrypotter,i ve heard there was a parseltongue in gryffindor once 
651,harrypotter,you would think that  in a magical universe where certain people can talk to certain animals  that you would see comparable examples across the board talking to birds  cats  what have you i would assume that they probably exist  but are nt viewed as inherently sinister like a parseltongue probably just as rare  though 
652,harrypotter,hitching on to this train of thought  would animagi be able to speak the tongue of the animal they can transform into  ie mcgonagall can talk to cats  sirius to dogs  etc  
653,harrypotter,i believe that parseltoungue is not exactly a learned of a learned language like english  mermish  or gobbledygook it is almost like a magical language that has an effect similar to the pseudolatin that is used for spells meaning that it carries magical effects i am basing this mostly on the basilisk in the chamber of secrets horcrux riddle tells harry that parseltongue wo nt help him stave off the king of serpents it does nt seem to make sense that one person that can control a snake with speech would be inherently better than another with the same ability  unless perhaps the magic behind it was stronger the chamber of secrets door  the bathroom sink  and the locket both seem to answer to the same series of hisses as far as we know  all salazar did was use a colloportus spell on it using parseltongue the counter charm would also have to be in parseltongue  because salazar did nt want anyone but the heir of slytherin to be able to enter following this chain of logic we have to assume that if salazar  whom arguably was the second smartest founder and the most cunning  was certain that parseltongue was only an inherited magical trait thus maintaining that only his descendants could continue his quest to be a radical racists err purists the inherited magical traits thought is supported by tonks and her explanation that metamorphmagus are born  and not made as explained later  arthur discovers some random selling metamorphmagus medals that do nt work this could explain that though metamorphmagus ca nt me made they can at least in theory be copied which will round up this long winded explanation of mine dumbledore  and ron could not speak parseltongue in my interpretation they can only copy it  or at least contextually analyze it ron could open the door because he had recently heard harry say the parselmouth equivalent of alohomora he roughly knew what to expect would happen by speaking it  much like harry knowing sectumsempra was for enemies dumbledore understood it because he was smart as hell and could interpret what was going on in the gaunt memories by morfins actions after marvolo spoke to him  tldr  dumbledore and ron ca nt speak parselmouth  at best they can copy or deduce what was being said you need to be a direct descendant of slytherin  or at lease a horcrux of one 
654,harrypotter,i do nt think those animals are special in the sense that those four wizards could talk to them  that cause and effect is reversed in salazar s case in my opinion   if there are wizards with the innate ability to talk to other animals  there s likely some that are attuned to any animal you can think of 
655,harrypotter,i think the repairo spell needs a bit of concentration about it for precision work like small electronics urainholly42 and the suggestion of scaling issue seems fairly close to the mark in my opinion in tootp harry smashes the murtlap essence and repairs the bowl  but the tentacles are lost in the process later on  during harry s occlumency tuition harry breaks one of the jars holding something weird and slimy in snapes office snape uses the repairo spell and fixes the jar  weird slimy thing an all so maybe it could be used to fix electronic devices if the wielder of the wand had enough knowledge of what he was doing dem muggle studies yall  do they even 
656,harrypotter,last october my girlfriend and i purchased tickets to see the cursed child in london on august 11 and 12 unfortunately  something recently came up with my girlfriend  s work and there  s no way we  ll be able to get to london at that time  i was wondering if there is any sort of ticket exchange or some other way we could possibly swap our tickets with someone who has tickets to a later showing any help would be greatly appreciated as we still really want to see the play in london thanks 
657,harrypotter,i have tickets for back to back parts 1 amp  2 on september 4th i need to sell does anyone know about transferring ownership  i know ticketmaster in the states is very particular about that and these tickets are will call 
658,harrypotter,hi  i got some questions i want to ask about the films i ve never read the books  but i plan to   and i guessed this would be the best place to ask them i m also on mobile so please tell me if the formatting is dodgy  first one is why was nt harry angry at dumbledore after harry died   he saw snape s memory of dumbledore manipulating harry into  raising him as pig to slaughter  yet when he saw him he did nt seem too bothered  in fact he looked like he still admired him  another question is what do you think harry thinks of his father after seeing snape s memory of him  cause to me it looked like he was a bully and stole lilly from him was there something that snape did that gave james the right to do that to him  or was it snape s hate for james that literally changed his memory  where did harry get the mirror shard and where did the mirror even come from  i ve looked through the films and there s no mention of it but then in the deathly hallows harry suddenly has it with no explanation  one more  what is the significance of snape s patronus  i know he loved lilly  but when dumbledore just randomly mentions lilly when he casts the doe  it s not really clear what he means  does he just ask if he loved her  would make sense after snape s  always   thanks guys i do love this subreddit  harry potter is pretty much my favourite film series as i grew up as the same age as harry and the lot  definitely an experience that i loved but did nt know was happening at the time 
659,harrypotter,this is the problem with watching the movies first     read the books asap the movies are fun entertainment but you wo nt get nearly as much out of them as you will out of the books i hope you get to soon and you re enjoying your hp journey  i can try to answer some of your questions  in the books harry goes through some more emotions about dumbledore having known he would need to die ultimately i think he comes out still admiring dumbledore because he knew how hard it was for him and that this was the only choice also  he was going through so many emotions about his own life that being mad at someone else was nt at the top of his mind  i think the jamessnape thing is very much up for debate i ve heard a lot of insightful things on this sub though  the mirror was from sirius he gave it to him as a gift there are two that are connected  the idea being sirius had one and harry had one and they would be able to talk through them   someone correct me if i m wrong but i think aberforth gets the other one after it was stolen from grimmauld place by mundungus  lily is represented by a doe this makes sense because she and james were together and his animagus  and probably patronus  was a stag the patronus is important because it is much stronger evidence that he still loves lily than just saying he does they talk about how only something really powerful emotionally can change a person s patronus  hope this helps other people help me out if i ve missed stuff i m sure i ve messed up a lot of spelling  sorry about that 
660,harrypotter,all of these questions are answered by the books  and some answered might be a little spoilery for some aspects that the movies never went into if you d rather not have any further spoilers  please stop reading here  a this is complicated and is actually a long overarcing thread in the last book through out the book  harry  at many points  feels very frustrated with dumbledore and the amount of secrets he kept from harry however he also comes to see that mostly when dumbledore was keeping secrets  it was as a benefit to harry it might not be something harry liked  but it was something he needed eventually  harry makes a decision to trust in dumbledore s judgement and sort of comes to accept that he can not always know everything and that sometimes he needs to not act  which is enormously hard for him   when he sees those memories  he does think about dumbledore s betrayal  but it feels to him as a minor thing against the knowledge that he has to die  gt  slowly  very slowly  he sat up  and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was  brain and nerve and bounding heart  it would all be gone    or at least  he would be gone from it his breath came slow and deep  and his mouth and throat were completely dry  but so were his eyes  gt  dumbledore  s betrayal was almost nothing of course there had been a bigger plan  harry had simply been too foolish to see it  he realized that now  the thing is that harry does see the sense of it he understands why dumbledore did what he did  and he understands why he is the one who has to die  and if it is him  then nobody else has to at this point  harry s emotions are a huge mess he is in a great state of shock and wanting to live but knowing he can not  so anger is not at the forefront of his brain eventually when he meets dumbledore  after being killed  by voldemort  the shock has worn off  but he is still mostly confused  which keeps him from feeling anger it also helps that pretty much one of the first things dumbledore tells him is that he is not exactly dead then dumbledore goes on to explain and apologises to harry  with tears in his eyes  which helps harry understand that everything dumbledore did  he did nt do for the funsies he made these decisions because they were the best ones  but they were nt easy or kind  not even on dumbledore himself  which is what helps harry come to peace with them  honestly  the books go way more in depth with harry s feelings re  dumbledore than anyone could ever do in a simple post  so i very much urge you to read them it will help clarify a lot  b when harry first finds out about the bully james was in the past  it actually bothers him a lot there is quite a chunk of the fifth book that deals with harry thinking about what he saw in the pensive and his father s behaviour he does quite a dangerous thing  using umbridge s fire to talk to sirius and lupin  just to get more information on his father s behaviour eventually he learns to give it a place he still loves his father  obviously  but he thinks of him with slightly less blind idealism still  from all accounts  it does seem like james  honestly  changed  and snape was nt exactly innocent in all of it either  james and snape pretty much continuously hexed each other  so it is not like james is an unrepenting douchebag either he s a person who made douchy choices as a teen  but also made a lot of good ones during that same time of his life  who eventually grew out of it  which is sort of how harry comes to remember him  c in the order of the phoenix  after christmas  sirius gives harry one of a pair of twoway mirrors but does nt explain them they are basically like mirror walkietalkies  that sirius and james used to use to talk to each other in detention harry  realising it is a way to contact sirius  fears that doing so will make sirius do something stupid and dangerous and puts them in the bottom of his trunk he forgets about them  even when he needs them most after sirius s death  harry remembers the mirror  however because sirius is dead  he can not use them anymore still  he does nt get rid of it it eventually shatters  but harry keeps the biggest piece the second mirror  the one that belonged to sirius is found by mundungus when he is looting sirius s house for stuff to sell he sells that mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother  who realises what is aberforth uses the mirror to keep an eye on harry  it is his blue eye harry sees  and eventually uses it to send dobby to them when they are in great danger  d snape loved lily snape has never loved anyone but lily lily cared great for him  as a friend  and potentially more according to jkr  but the path snape put himself on  the one with the dark arts  turned her away from him it all came to a head when snape called her a mudblood lily ended their friendship there  but snape did nt stop loving her because he loved her  he tried to ask voldemort to spare her  and through that  gave lily an out  which she refused to take but instead protected her son   knowing that snape loved lily so much  dumbledore used that love to get snape on their side when dumbledore asks if snape s feeling are still the same after all this time  snape casts that patronus  lily s patronus had been a doe as well  and tell him  yes  always he s still in this for lily 
661,harrypotter,1  i totally forget how harry reacts after he sees the memories i think maybe he just sits down and cries for a bit  it was a lot to take in  2  snape kicks harry out of the dungeons after that lesson iirc  harry basically runs out of the dungeons and ends up on some stairs feeling nauseous about how he just saw his father behave  25  sirius and james had started to bully snape on the hogwarts express before they had even gotten sorted yet both james and sirius came from money and gave snape crap for wanting to be in slytherin house  like his mother eileen was   so  snape did not instigate the bullying by fifth year  snape was very much into the dark arts and was hanging around shady people and james was about to stop being such an arse all the time from snape s point of view  james stole her from lily s point of view  snape had <URL> toxic and james was a changed man calling her a mudblood was the last straw and she cut snape out of her life and james and her clicked and they started dating  snape s memory did nt change what james didwas james grew up and matured  3  in order of the phoenix   at 12 grimmauld during the christmas holidays i think   sirius gives harry a package and tells him if he ever should need to be in contact  to use what s in the package harry has just seen a spat between snape and sirius and does not want to be the reason sirius ends up getting killed so  harry never opens the package  which contained the mirror shard he  does  open the package  after  sirius has died and feels like an idiot for not having opened it sooner mundungus feltcher ends up stealing stuff from grimmauld place after sirius dies he ends up selling the other half of the mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother who owns the hog s head tavern   so  when harry keeps seeing bright blue eyes in the mirror during deathly hallows  it s actually aberforth keeping a watchful eye on harry in case he needs help  4  dumbledore had just asked snape if he had grown to care about harry snape casts his patronus it s a doe just like lily s patronus was a doe dumbledore realizes that snape is still fighting for lily  lily after all this time   snape replies  always   in that snape had always loved lily in that he never stopped  or will stop  loving her 
662,harrypotter,one of my best friends is a giant harry potter fan and i always turned my nose to it  thinking it was childish and nerdy  on new year s day this year  i sat and wrote a list of all the movies i wanted to watch before the end of the year and i decided to put the hp series on the list  totally expecting to further justify my ill feelings for it  well  my wife  who always shared similar feelings on the topic  and i just finished deathly hallows pt 1 and we are hooked we ve watched all the films up until this point over the past couple of weeks and we re also reading the books we ve definitely found a new love 
663,harrypotter,<URL>  little lady  here s  something     <URL>  just for you  i hope you positively  love  it 
664,harrypotter,have you read the books  oh man  you guys should definitely read the books together  that would no doubt be a very wonderful experience 
665,harrypotter,read the books i am not even close to bullshitting you when i say they are so  so  so much better than the films there s a fuck ton of content that was left out of the movies for a lot of mundane filler  you ll be doing yourself a favour  
666,harrypotter,<URL> to the fandom 
667,harrypotter,i m such a fan of harry also  swoon 
668,harrypotter,one of us  one of us  one of us  one of us 
669,harrypotter,<URL> to the culi mean  the club   d
670,harrypotter,you should also listen to the audio tapes  c 
671,harrypotter,i hope this also prompts you to try not to judge things before you ve readseen them  you could be missing out on awesome stuff 
672,harrypotter,i cant imagine anyone getting into hp from just watching the movies because they re a horrible misinterpretation of the books i suppose the millions of plot holes in them get people reading which is a good thing 
673,harrypotter,a lot was changed for the movies  doing many of the characters a great disservice i strongly suggest you read the books  too 
674,harrypotter,it s cultural 
675,harrypotter,and you watched the movies  lame 
676,harrypotter,  <URL>
677,harrypotter,some variety of bowtruckle

685,harrypotter,ebony  phoenix feather  12 inches  supple
686,harrypotter,i remember reading the harry potter books with my girlfriend it was fun reading them together i m curious what you guys will think after seeing deathly hallows pt 2 
687,harrypotter,if you already preordered  you get the lowest price it s listed for so all of us who preordered the  30  are now getting it for  1<SMILE> 
688,harrypotter,excuse the missing word and typo 
689,harrypotter,you can get it for 1499 via digital download from barnes and noble 
690,harrypotter,pine  phoenix feather  10 34 inches  surprisingly swishy same as op 
691,harrypotter,since reparo fixes physical damage it will work on certain things you need to go deep into the device for example  if my phone was nt working  and the real problem would be component inside that is cracked  burned etc it will get fixed on the other hand  if  as mentioned here  it was like loose wire inside the device  it would nt get fixed because it s perfectly fine  just not connected to the circuit in order to work  if you re going to be a technician in real world  your magic skills will make your job a lot easier all you have to do is use reparo on it  and if it still wo nt work  you know that something is disconnected and not broken  3 also  the basic of not ruining the electronic while trying to repair it is to turn it off same as you would do to repair it with muggle technology 
692,harrypotter,  dolores umbridge    she s absolutely despicable  i loathed her all the way through the ootp  and then when we saw her again in the dh  i could nt believe how nice she d found the new regime and how she fit in it  even though she was never a death eater 
693,harrypotter,petunia when you re introduced to vernon and petunia  you get the feeling that vernon is the one who is out to get harry the most  what with the ridiculous antics in reality  petunia has a grudge about seven miles wide and is almost entirely aware of what harry potter represents to the wizarding world at large  and  keeps him in a cupboard under the stairs out of spite  
694,harrypotter,romilda vane is about the only character in the series whose presence i actively hate 
695,harrypotter,  rita skeeter    she reminded me of someone i know she was the cliche annoying reporter who put her own spin on everything the part that really sealed it was in interview about dumbledore and she said her and harry were in contact  drove me nuts    cho chang    i just found her horribly irritating 
696,harrypotter,justin finchfletchley i m still seething over the whole parseltonguewizard duel scene  malfoy  conjures a snake  it goes for j finch  then and  only then  does harry start speaking parseltongue  and the snake backs off really  he s smart enough to get into eton but he concludes from these events that harry sicced the snake on him  surely muggleborn justin finchfletchley should have no preexisting parselmouthbias i can only conclude that he s a colossal idiot  and that s before you consider his very punchable face in the movies 
697,harrypotter,there are plenty of characters that i love to hate  looking at you umbridge   but i do nt know that there are any characters whose actual existence i hate  i was nt a big fan of cho chang post cedric diggory  but i guess if i had to choose my least favourite harry potter character is that nigel character from the movies why not just use a creevey brother for that role 
698,harrypotter,pettigrew he s just a massive  slimy coward 
699,harrypotter,i used to be ambivalent about him but  sirius black in the span of one night  harry goes from fear of being murdered by him  to being ready to follow him home like a puppy sirius being his dad s best friend notwithstanding  harry still does nt know the guy hell  harry does nt even know his dad i get that living with the dursleys sucked  but damn  and this is all before we knew what a jerkass he was in school he sent snape off to go see remus in his werewolf form when james found out  he was the one who saved snape from being attacked which means that sirius was nt going to do anything to stop it he was going to let one of his best friends eat the weird kid 
700,harrypotter,ginny she s about as deep as a small puddle 
701,harrypotter,wormtail of course  because he is a coward and the kind of person that is mean to his friends because they threat you well  but they never say anything to somebody that will hurt them so its easy for him to betray his friends and leave his own mother to go and live as a rat  because he knew that the good people would nt kill him  but voldemort s supporters would 
702,harrypotter,villians  i really wanted to say  dolores umbridge   but she at least got jailed  while another disgusting person    rita skeeter   was never punished i guess that in britain s magical law there is no such thing as defamation in muggle world skeeter would ve drown in lawsuits   heroes     james potter    of course rich  spoiled brat  basically gryffindor s draco malfoy except everybody loves him because  yknow  rich and handsome 
703,harrypotter,zacharias smith probably he s not the worst person out there but even the bad guys have a bit of the  love to hate them  vibe going on  or they re interesting enough as characters to make me enjoy reading about them smith is just a jackass  honorable mentions to hagrid and dobby 
704,harrypotter,i really hated pettigrew 
705,harrypotter,  remus lupin   passiveaggressive  emotionallycowardly jerk he was the only good guy character that truly aggravated me  of the ones basically built for readers to hate    umbridge   was the worst i feel more comfortable when characters run into bellatrix lestrange umbridge is justdiabolical 
706,harrypotter,cho chang partly because she was so pathetic and did nt know how good a thing she had with going out with harry  young me was in love   but as the series moved on and harry became older  i actually really started to dislike him  he was moody  ungrateful  whiney  selfpitying and over dramatic i felt like if i ever met a boy like him in real life i d have no problems telling him to suck it up and shut up there were times he made me want to skip his lines in the book  also  in terms of the movies  i hated all the girls simply on the principle that they were there on set and i was not  p
707,harrypotter,obviously umbridge  but i ll be honest  harry himself is right up there snape constantly accuses him of every trait that drives me up the wall with him 
708,harrypotter,umbridge reminds me of hillary
709,harrypotter,i want him to do it with me 
710,harrypotter,i remember reading that and wondering about it i was thinking  why did he have that look  what was he thinking   i am so happy you made this post o grade for you 
711,harrypotter,yep the first one i saw on my first run on the books is when trelawney has her real prediction in front of harry when harry reports it to dumbledore  he says something like   that s her second real prophecy  harry did not inquire what was the first one  which was revealed only on the 5th book 
712,harrypotter,when dh had nt been released yet  a lot of people thought this moment meant dumbledore was actually a follower of voldemort 
713,harrypotter,gt  yes it would have cost them their afterlives i think this is it accepting the afterlife is  within this world  the more brave and enlightened choice most people choose death it takes an extreme fear to choose to remain on the earth as a ghost  and i think it may be something ghosts regret  gt   wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth  to walk palely where their living selves once trod   said nick miserably  but very few wizards choose that path  gt   you  re dead  aren  t you   said harry exasperatedly  who can answer better than you   gt   i was afraid of death   said nick  i chose to remain behind i sometimes wonder whether i oughtn  t to have    well  that is neither here nor there    in fact  i am neither here nor there     he gave a small sad chuckle  i know nothing of the secrets of death  harry  for i chose my feeble imitation of life instead  which then leads us to ask why voldemort did not choose this option  perhaps because his soul was nt whole enough to make that choice  i think  in the end  voldemort s fate is far far worse than that even of a ghost  and though dumbledore says  do not pity the dead   i think he means those that chose a normal afterlife i think in this world  ghosts are to be pitied 
714,harrypotter,lockhart i can barely get through cos because of his constant need for attention for things he did nt do   he takes credit for what others did for fame i loathe him 
715,harrypotter,dumbledore  because he played too many games with people s lives it s like he thought everyone were pieces on a chess board he seems very calculated in the decisions he made though in real life personally  i d rather deal with voldemort  because at least you know what you re getting yourself into he s straight up with how he feels  and what he s going to do to you he plays no games 
716,harrypotter,oh my these are actually amazing i need to get these when i get paid 
717,harrypotter,voldemort on the bad guys  side dumbledore on the good guys  side umbridge earns the special award
718,harrypotter,very interesting look at the series i ve been very curious about what harry and co s state of mind will be like in the cursed child considering what they ve each seen 
719,harrypotter,percy weasley he is the most dickish character in the series i mean yea i hate dolores but he was just mean to his parents and his whole family  the people who will unconditionally love him no matter what and that to me is unforgivable 
720,harrypotter,one of my best friends is a giant harry potter fan and i always turned my nose to it  thinking it was childish and nerdy  on new year s day this year  i sat and wrote a list of all the movies i wanted to watch before the end of the year and i decided to put the hp series on the list  totally expecting to further justify my ill feelings for it  well  my wife  who always shared similar feelings on the topic  and i just finished deathly hallows pt 1 and we are hooked we ve watched all the films up until this point over the past couple of weeks and we re also reading the books we ve definitely found a new love 
721,harrypotter,i d be very concerned having people in court swear the unbreakable vow some people ca nt even handle getting legit information out of their head when they have to do tests in school because they re so freaking nervousanxious now think of some insecure earlyneville type of guy being questioned by someone like umbrigde witnesses would drop dead one by one simply for being nervous and confused
722,harrypotter,needs more jpeg   s

730,harrypotter,i do nt think they are  but do  they     <URL>  come framed

732,harrypotter,i posted this one a few days ago  but here s a little filler i got to my hpthemed leg piece on saturday    <URL> also  here s the rest of the piece  before i got the  all was well  filler     <URL>
733,harrypotter,as dumbledore said  i think they sort too early
734,harrypotter,i think percy would be very distraught at being in slytherin
735,harrypotter,i imagine the sorting hat also considers the benefits of having a more or less equal number of students sorted into each house  or considers the houses  current capacity to accept new students in terms of dorms  teachertostudent ratios  etc 
736,harrypotter,mediamerlin s beard  awesome tag 
737,harrypotter,these are very cool  the fool is perfect now i m thinking of what might be on the other cards 
738,harrypotter,beech wood  12 34 in  unicorn hair
739,harrypotter,a galleon for a crepe  better be one bangin  crepe 
740,harrypotter,this is so cute  i wish my ta was into harry potter our theme was not nearly as cool you should add hermione s spew hats and socks for the unsuspecting elves to the gryffindor area  
741,harrypotter,the weird sisters
742,harrypotter,fabulous  where did you find this 
743,harrypotter,shout out to boston redditors  will have to check this out 
744,harrypotter,international house of pancakes  seriously  though  it s kind of like asking which house of congress kanye west would be better suited for  at any rate  jk has already pointed out that while she briefly considered dudley ending up with a magical child  she ultimately decided that magical blood had no chance of <URL> dursley dna 
745,harrypotter,that is amazing  you are my hero of the day 
746,harrypotter,holy fucking shit looking at these gave me goosebumps these are the greatest harry potter posters that have ever existed where do i send all my money to receive my own 
747,harrypotter,the sorting hat tries to put you where you can find your equals  the hat also knows all the students of each house  so it might take this in consideration harry disliked malfoy from the start  the hat probably saw this  it also knew that sirius and james had already met in the hogwarts train and so on you think voldemort would have turned out good and kind just because he was put in hufflepuff  no  but the slytherin house were the one in which he found his equals  people of ambition and that shared his ideals  so there is no solid answer  sometimes it puts you in a house to balance your traits  hermione was very clever  but gryffindor balanced her somewhat  she certainly did things that she would not have done in ravenclaw malfoy was put into slytherin because he wanted to  he had the traits and etc  if the hat wanted to simply  balance  his personality  then it should have put him in gryffindor for example neville wanted to go to hufflepuff  but the hat insisted and chose gryffindor instead 
748,harrypotter,assuming this is current  i will make this happen for you 
749,harrypotter,to be fair  they all forgot their robes starting around movie  3 
750,harrypotter,love paris creperie  their food truck is great too 
751,harrypotter,i live less than a mile from there 
752,harrypotter,i ca nt remember if there was ever explicit mention of a stained glass window in the books or not  but that could be it 
753,harrypotter,probably arithmancy or ancient runes 
754,harrypotter,this is posted monthly
755,harrypotter,looks like runes on the top and bottom of the page it could also be a ward  or a curse that has been revealed by some other sort of magic call up bill weasley he used to be a curse breaker 
756,harrypotter,it s been nearly a decade guys  i want to line up for something please 
757,harrypotter,this was a really interesting way to open the 6th book this book has a lot of interesting chapters before we even get to potter  because isnt the next chapter spinners end  i love this book though 
758,harrypotter,harrytine now there s a holiday i could get behind 
759,harrypotter,i know exactly how you feel i lent my books to my grandmother since she wanted to read them my grandparents  house burned down in a wildfire a few months later  my grandparents were fine  they were in switzerland at the time 
760,harrypotter,10 sweet points for these sweets 
761,harrypotter,maybe something alchemy related  the philosophers stone is usually symbolized as a lion eating a sun  the sun looks just like that one idk just thinking out loud
762,harrypotter,i had previously heard that this chapter would have been in the chamber of secrets  but i m still unsure as to how  what would they discuss 
763,harrypotter,integrating the  new  pottermore information would definitely change the style and flow of the story like in lemony snicket s tangents or romantic authors  florid pagelong descriptions  eragon and septimus heap had an appendix at the end to expand some of the lore and etymologies  otherwise  i can only think of those annotated shakespeare editions that put notes into the margins it preserves some of the formatting from overly long footnotes at the bottom of the page or those dreaded bracketed numbers where you have to constantly flip back and forth 
764,harrypotter,almost a kabbalah chart    <URL>  20of  20the  20hebrews  20redrawn  20webjpg which has a lot to do with old beliefs of magic and the occult 
765,harrypotter,i think the repairo spell needs a bit of concentration about it for precision work like small electronics urainholly42 and the suggestion of scaling issue seems fairly close to the mark in my opinion in tootp harry smashes the murtlap essence and repairs the bowl  but the tentacles are lost in the process later on  during harry s occlumency tuition harry breaks one of the jars holding something weird and slimy in snapes office snape uses the repairo spell and fixes the jar  weird slimy thing an all so maybe it could be used to fix electronic devices if the wielder of the wand had enough knowledge of what he was doing dem muggle studies yall  do they even 
766,harrypotter,since reparo fixes physical damage it will work on certain things you need to go deep into the device for example  if my phone was nt working  and the real problem would be component inside that is cracked  burned etc it will get fixed on the other hand  if  as mentioned here  it was like loose wire inside the device  it would nt get fixed because it s perfectly fine  just not connected to the circuit in order to work  if you re going to be a technician in real world  your magic skills will make your job a lot easier all you have to do is use reparo on it  and if it still wo nt work  you know that something is disconnected and not broken  3 also  the basic of not ruining the electronic while trying to repair it is to turn it off same as you would do to repair it with muggle technology 
767,harrypotter,yes it does  but if the electronic is too damaged then it would depend on the skill of the wizard  you do not need to know how the item works or its parts or whatever  just intent and the incantation will do harry could not make the liquid go back to the basin once he broke it  but slughorn and dumbledore did it with the dragon blood that was on the walls 
768,harrypotter,mother of merlin 
769,harrypotter,snape did nt hate james solely because of lily snape hated james for numerous other reasons  and that s visible when snape compares harry to his father snape vehemently uses words like arrogant to refer to james  and by extension  harry   and he references james  apparent tendency to believe  rules were for lesser mortals  not quidditch cup winners  james relationship with lily  and the fact that  as her housemate  james could spend far more time with lily  might have played a role  but snape hated james because he hated james  not because he loved lily  also  even if remus did suspect  it s not exactly a logical leap to imagine that snape hangs around lily because he has a crush   it s hardly the time to mention it 
770,harrypotter,gryffindor dudley s real crybaby behavior comes out around petunia i think we see the true dudley with the dementors when he thinks harry is performing magic and threats wo nt stop him  he slugs harry then  he gets away wrong direction  but it s the proactive behavior that counts  i agree hufflepuff s a possibility too he was nt a hard worker at 11  but i think that changes when the diet starts he starts so overweight and unhealthy that he feels tired going from the kitchen to the living room a year later  he s a boxing champion who is more muscle than fat that takes hard work 
771,harrypotter,love the style  i ve been heavily contemplating getting a dark mark for a few years now 
772,harrypotter,i m on book 5 and it really seems like that was a glaring oversight and the most that people tell harry is   do nt lose your temper 
773,harrypotter,breaking news  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said the senate should not confirm a replacement for supreme court justice antonin scalia until after all of the late justice  s horcruxes have been destroyed   a horcrux is a powerful artifact in which a wizard has hidden a piece of his or her soul in hopes of attaining immortality   stated mcconnell  justice scalia  s body may be dead but  by creating horcruxes  dark lord scalia gained the ability to anchor his soul to the earth   it  s not a surprise   said a senior white house official  we  ve known for some time that scalia was inching closer and closer to true immortality as his body withered away  republicans in congress and in the 2016 presidential field united behind mcconnell  contending that the circumstances of scalia  s death  the first horcrux chase since frank murphy famously thrust a dragon  s tooth through the diary of pierce butler before being confirmed  made it necessary to leave the appointment until every piece of scalia  s tangible soul had been vanquished  senate minority leader harry reid lined up firmly behind president obama  the president can and should send the senate a nominee right away   he said in a statement  it would be unprecedented in recent history for a supreme court seat to remain vacant while a team of courageous wizards hunt down the vestiges of scalia  s dark power  calls to honor the tradition of highcourt nominations in spite of the dark wizard  s shadowy tokens were immediately rejected by senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley  riowa   who stated plainly that he has no plans to start up the confirmation process on his panel until the last relics had been quelled   this president  above all others  has made no bones about his goal to use the courts to circumvent the will of dark wizards and push through his own agenda   grassley said  it only makes sense that we wait until the ghostly monuments of his darkness have been dismantled before moving forward  by using his power as chairman to block a vote in committee  grassley can prevent democrats from trying to call up a nomination on the senate floor  at least until every antique carrying the spirit of scalia has been lay waste to  sens rubio of florida and cruz of texas urged mcconnell to block a new confirmation rubio said the nomination could absolutely not occur while the horcruxes remained by threat of armageddon  while cruz bluntly said it is the senate  s duty to slow down a confirmation process until the cold heirlooms of the late justice had been found and eradicated   justice scalia was a dark wizard we owe it to him  amp  the nation  for the senate to ensure that there is no replacement while the power of scalia  s horcruxes remains   cruz said on twitter  wrote this while bored of working hope you enjoyed it  jacob van lunen
774,harrypotter,welli have a couple extras lying round i have no use for pm me your address do you want hardback or softback 
775,harrypotter,i have a facebook friend who works there as a member of the singing frog choir  and she seemed to start training this week she just posted a picture of the whole choir in costume in the park  so they must be getting ready to start that portion soon 
776,harrypotter,merlin who by the way was a slytherin 
777,harrypotter,measuring by mere power the answer is dumbledore in his prime  he defeated the elder wand owner grindelwald in a duel and he did nt even had to kill him voldemort is powerful of course  but he spams the killing curse too much  it is much easier to simply kill somebody  and he was forced to conjure a silver shield to defend himself against dumbledore s spell  i always thought it was some sort of unblockable stunning spell  something that you can not defend using just a shield charm  only a material object can defend against it 
778,harrypotter,i read the books between <SMILE> and 14 as they came out  so i did nt retain a whole lot the first time through  she gives harry a lot more detention and shows absolutely no remorse for actually physically abusing him in fact  she often says he needs more i also just finished the chapter where she bans him  fred  and george from the quidditch team i completely forgot about that and man does it piss me off especially when she says she decided to go to fudge when mcgonagalldumbledore allowed the gryffindor team to reform and when she says she wants their brooms confiscated and put in her office  i knew i hated her  but now i m relearning why 
779,harrypotter,i felt the exact same way when i re read she honestly made it hard for me to read 
780,harrypotter,definitely  and then all of the things she happily does under voldemort s ministry regime later on she s a horrifying and disgusting person  and every bit as bad as the death eaters 
781,harrypotter,i hate her more and more every time i ve reread them fred and george are my hero s in the book because of their defiance to umbridge though she did pretty much seal their pursuit foe a joke shop 
782,harrypotter,i feel there was nt enough in the movies actually it seems worse in the movies because all the pranks and fighting back against her  catharsis  fireworks  weasleys  is nt in the movie until just before they go to the ministry and the decrees were in higher number so i imagine in the film s universe it felt a lot worse whereas in the books it would ve been better 
783,harrypotter,the scene in ootp where she humiliates hagrid during one of his lessons fills me with so much rage the fact that she gets so much joy from having power over other people  i ca nt handle it  i found  this writing     <URL>  about umbridge from jk rowling pretty enjoyable  though   
784,harrypotter,lol  i have to say the character portrayal in the movies is good  too too good  in fact that i still hate the actress when i watched maleficient and saw her as one of the faeries 
785,harrypotter,in a matter of speaking they are doing a technical run  and almost everything is open up for use by the general public you can go on the rides  get wands  and drink some butterbeer however  i was told that this was subject to change and that they will be open or closed in a random sort of way  but if you have a pass i d say give it a shot and try to see if it s open 
786,harrypotter,it s been nearly a decade guys  i want to line up for something please 
787,harrypotter,i hope so cause i really wan na go to one 
788,harrypotter,yes  it just depends on where i ve seen multiple people online say their local bookstores are planning midnight release parties already maybe check with a local bookstore and let them know you re interested and they might announce something 
789,harrypotter,great  durmstrang just got even more badass as if it needed it
790,harrypotter,i m german and have never made that connection now i feel rather silly
791,harrypotter,i always thought it was because nothing makes her happier than terrorizing nonpure bloods  and that is the happiness feeding her patronus
792,harrypotter,well fuck
793,harrypotter,good post  that man needed recognition
794,harrypotter,it s  15 via ibooks 
795,harrypotter,excuse the missing word and typo 
796,harrypotter,you can get it for 1499 via digital download from barnes and noble 
797,harrypotter,you forgot to make his eyes green he has his mothers eyes  exactly his mothers eyes  
798,harrypotter,i do nt know why it took me this long to notice this  but the name  hermione  is a derivative from hermes  but not necessarily from hermes the greek messenger god of trickery  trade  theft  heroes  and of course communication  hermes was merged with mercury by the romans   for the greeks had other gods named hermes  hermione s name fits all too well with the syncretic god hermes trismegastis  hermes trismegastis  famed deity for which the hermaneutic method is named  is thought by many scholars to be a syncretic divinity combining the greek god hermes with the egyptian god thoth the ancient greeks had noticed that both gods were gods of magic and scribes  and other forms of written communication   ie bookish they both were psychopomps  divine figures who escort others to the afterlife or the underworld hermes trismegastis combined within him hermes  godhood over communication and heroism and thoth s godhood over astrology  alchemy  and wisdom  it seems fitting that hermione could be named after the syncretic god of scribes  magic  heroism  and wisdom  on the other hand  although jk is known for her clever naming of characters in the harry potter stories  this could also be simply a pleasant convenience  i ve googled about this and found nothing to tell me one way or the other  does anyone know 
799,harrypotter,1  iirc  jkr was a classics major she knows this  2  i think  given her extensive study of the classics   this     enwikipediaorgwikihermione_   mythology    is as likely a source  although less cool 3  to be completely fair  i think the original mythological figure in 2 was also likely named after hermes  in one aspect or another   so i still think this is pretty awesome
800,harrypotter,i always thought she was named after hermes because she is a messenger for the underrepresented like with spew 
801,harrypotter,my take on why most electronics can not not work in a magical environment is because magic  as a field of energy interferes with the electric field and jams the current or something we see that it takes a great deal of effort to modify electronic equipment before they can work with magic  eg mr weasley s efforts with the car  although how ron could use the fellytone  remains to be explained   so i m guessing that work goes into vanishing all electric related components  such as wires  magnets  circuit boards  and replacing them with some other thing  i would presume magic would be unable to repair electronics  since it stops them from working even when not broken however uelstren suggested  a milimeter mistake means it wo nt work   which suggest it might be a scaling issueperhaps it requires a lot of precision and an ability to move things at a very small scale which most wizards or witches would nt be familiar with in their daytoday use of magic i expect eventually a really bright muggleborn will figure this out and invent a new type of spell that would tap on the electric field itself to achieve the minute changes required to repair electronics  but woah  this is venturing into a whole new area haha edit  added more thoughts
802,harrypotter,supposedly  magic and technology do nt exactly get along but would a fixing spell work on electronics 
803,harrypotter,reparo seems to fix physical damage so maybe but it may be difficult  this wire with this wire and that here and this here  as even a millimeter mistake means it wo nt work so something like an old radio will be ok  a new cell phone will be far more difficult i wonder if the wizard has to know the object to repair it 
804,harrypotter,since reparo fixes physical damage it will work on certain things you need to go deep into the device for example  if my phone was nt working  and the real problem would be component inside that is cracked  burned etc it will get fixed on the other hand  if  as mentioned here  it was like loose wire inside the device  it would nt get fixed because it s perfectly fine  just not connected to the circuit in order to work  if you re going to be a technician in real world  your magic skills will make your job a lot easier all you have to do is use reparo on it  and if it still wo nt work  you know that something is disconnected and not broken  3 also  the basic of not ruining the electronic while trying to repair it is to turn it off same as you would do to repair it with muggle technology

807,harrypotter,i ve wondered this before  too in hbp  slughorn and dumbledore do some kind of magic to repair all of the items in the muggle house that slughorn destroyed in an attempt to hide not sure how many of the items are slughorn s and how many are the muggles   and maybe none of them are electronic  but they seem to put them all back together again with no problems  maybe it has to do with the relative skill of the witchwizard and their knowledge of the broken items 
808,harrypotter,yes it does  but if the electronic is too damaged then it would depend on the skill of the wizard  you do not need to know how the item works or its parts or whatever  just intent and the incantation will do harry could not make the liquid go back to the basin once he broke it  but slughorn and dumbledore did it with the dragon blood that was on the walls 
809,harrypotter,maybe  i hope so  it would it would be very useful

815,harrypotter,i have already read all of the potter books multiple times  but it s been a few years and i was looking to do so again as a frequent member of book clubs  i thought it could be enjoyable to find someone to read along with this seemed a good place to find someone for that   so if you like the idea and would nt mind taking the journey with a 37yearold fella  send me a message or write on kik to iamhereiguess
816,harrypotter,i just commented on another post earlier that i ve been itching to read them again i d be happy to read along with ya  you never know what unanswered questions you may still have or maybe catch something you ve never noticed before until you read with someone else  
817,harrypotter,you could always join us over at rdueling for harry potter trivia 
818,harrypotter,i would be interested i ve reread them many many times but would be happy to again 
819,harrypotter,in the third book lupin describes the boggart and since it takes the form of whatever the person in front of it fears most no one knows what it looks like when it is alone then in the fifth book there is the boggart in the upstairs room of number 12 and molly asks moody to look at it since the boggart ca nt see moody it must have been in its regular form i wonder what it looks like 
820,harrypotter,for some reason i always imagine them like  this     cdnbulbagardennetuploadthumb662093haunterpng250px093haunterpng  
821,harrypotter,i have a theory  it is invisible in its neutral form kinda like a ghost as portrayed in modern times  where it s invisible but can move things and stuff like that if that s the case  then moody did nt even notice it 
822,harrypotter,personally  i imagine it as a bluesilver sphere however  the reason that s the case is that i did nt realize what happened when it turned into a moon in front of lupin  and even though i now know that s wrong  it stuck 
823,harrypotter,that is so beautiful  i especially like the lettering lovely work 
824,harrypotter,on wow its beautiful who made it 
825,harrypotter,my friend and i do a podcast twice a week in which we review original music from the internet for one of our episodes this week i was thinking we d talk about wizard rock  we re aware of draco and the malfoys are there any other groups that are nt terrible

838,harrypotter,you forgot to make his eyes green he has his mothers eyes  exactly his mothers eyes  
839,harrypotter, link to previous chapter     <URL>    synopsis   we meet the muggle prime minister he s thinking about all the recent tragedies that have happened a person in a painting coughs and announces the arrival of fudge they discuss recent events the muggle prime minister reminisces about previous meetings with fudge fudge then reveals to the prime minister that voldemort is back they talk about sirius black  the bridge collapse  the giant attack in the west country  amelia bones  emmeline vance and the dementors he then reveals that he has been outed as minister of magic he introduces his successor  rufus scrimguer he talks about security for the prime minister  kingsley and the junior minister who is quacking    poi    jo considered including this chapter in chamber of secrets but it ended up being cut and put here   if we were to apply this to the real world  the most likely candidate for who the muggle prime minister is sir john major who was prime minister of the uk from 1990 to 1997 although that does nt really fit with what fudge says about the previous prime minister he refers to him as a male but the prime minister who preceded sir john was margaret thatcher   there s a talk of a bridge collapse here and in the movies they collapse the millennium bridge however  that bridge opened on june 2000 which was after the events of the main narrative of the harry potter novels the bridge that collapsed in the novel is the brockdale bridge   the opposition leader talks about a grim mood gripping the country fudge confirms this later in this chapter that it is caused by the dementors so is there job just to walk around spreading misery for voldemort  why do nt they kiss more muggles  particularly since they ca nt see them   the opposition leader is described as barely concealing his glee about the recent atrocities and it kinda reminded me why i hate politics   the painting that connects the ministry of magic and the muggle prime minister who is that  was it a real person  did that person hold high offices in both the muggle and wizarding world  does that painting person just have to stay as still as possible most of the day   how would they be able to make the president of the other country forget to call  would nt they have to cast the spell on him directly  do the other ministries of magic from around the world collude to organise meetings for each other   is there a code of ethics for casting spells on muggle leaders  are there certain things you ca nt do   i think wizards really do nt understand how arrogant they sound to others it s a constant complaint about them from centaurs to goblins to the prime minister here   do you think former prime ministers in this world get together and discuss what they know of the magical world   when jo originally planned the series  terrorism was nt nearly the issue that it was when this book was published the world events of the time really give the terrorist actions of the death eaters more emotional weight in the mind of the reader than what would have happened otherwise   fudge changes a tea cup into a gerbil violation of the gamp law about food   if you ca nt remove the painting from the wall  why not remove the wall itself  surely it would be possible i know there s likely a permanent sticking charm here but there s ways around that   how did it take an hour to explain the story of voldemort  how much information is the muggle prime minister given here   under what circumstances is the minister of magic obligated to contact the muggle prime minister   it says that they re importing three foreign dragons now would the common welsh green count as a foreign dragon  you d think not right  which kinda suggests that the champions were originally just meant to fight the other three dragons and presumably the welsh green was the ring in when they needed another to fight harry   for the muggle prime minister to find out why these terrible things are happening but not be able to tell anyone about it or do anything about it must be frustrating as hell  if the muggles united together with the wizards  do you think they would be able to take voldemort down    is a man alive if he can not be killed   it s a surprisingly deep philosophical question here from fudge   we find out that amelia bones has been killed her brother and his wife were murdered in the first war what does voldemort have against this family  why target them   we also find out about emmeline vance s murder the only time we met her previously was as a member of the advance guard in ootp  the most obvious analogy we can make with fudge and scrimgeur is neville chamberlain and winston churchill fudge is the weaker option who seemingly let voldemort take a foothold again and scrimgeur is the fighter a wizard who is seen as tough and fit for war   fudge implies here that he wanted to get harry to speak out in his favour just like scrimgeur attempts later but surelywhy would fudge think that harry would just forgive him for all the shit he put him through the last year  no one could forgive that   the quote that i ve selected at the bottom is important jo talks about this a bit how magic is nt the solution to problems you ca nt just wave your wand and make bad things go away magic is nt the magic bullet    quotable quote   the trouble is  the other side can do magic to  prime minister 
840,harrypotter,this was a really interesting way to open the 6th book this book has a lot of interesting chapters before we even get to potter  because isnt the next chapter spinners end  i love this book though 
841,harrypotter,gt  fudge changes a tea cup into a gerbil violation of the gamp law about food  how so  there are multiple instances in the series where they transfigure an inanimate object into an animal  such as when cedric transfigures a rock into a dog when fighting his dragon in gof   by your logic that should impossible  as a violation of the gamp law too i think somehow  magic  is able to tell the difference between food and living animals  gt  if you ca nt remove the painting from the wall  why not remove the wall itself  surely it would be possible i know there s likely a permanent sticking charm here but there s ways around that  yeah  but it would be fairly obvious if the prime minister started trying to remove the wall people in his office would ask him what he was doing  and when he refused answer  they would definitely think he was going crazy even if he called in a professional construction crew to remove wall  they would still expect to be paid the prime minister is going to have a difficult time explaining why he s spending the taxpayers  money on renovating a building that has no structural issues  gt  fudge implies here that he wanted to get harry to speak out in his favour just like scrimgeur attempts later but surelywhy would fudge think that harry would just forgive him for all the shit he put him through the last year  no one could forgive that  i do nt think fudge cared whether or not harry  forgave  him  i think he assumed that he could bribe harry with the promise of political benefits  such as offering him a fasttrack into <URL> an auror   but was ultimately disappointed to learn that harry was not for sale  as he was  dumbledore s man through and through 
842,harrypotter,this is one of my favourite chapters in the whole series
843,harrypotter,gt  gt  the painting that connects the ministry of magic and the muggle prime minister who is that  was it a real person  did that person hold high offices in both the muggle and wizarding world  does that painting person just have to stay as still as possible most of the day  ulick gamp  first minister for magic 
844,harrypotter,the painting of the man that was in the prime ministers office was the first wizard prime minister of the wizarding worldit says it in the chapter  i dont have it with me   i think the muggles would be confused and scared of wizards so i do nt know if that was ever a likely scenariobut if it did happen i do nt know if they could even if they unitevoldemort has giantsmagical means of hidingan army of ruthless death eaters and was able to elude capture for decadestechnology at the time was nt as developed to override magic  amelia bones was a powerful witchwe have instances in the story where if voldemort asks them to join and they refuse he wo nt tolerate ithe ca nt have powerful enemies that could fight him  fudge was desperate and weakfudge asked dumbledore to persuade him because he knows that harry might listeneven harry says himself he s dumbledore man through and through  i like your analogies and observations       yay     
845,harrypotter,gt  we find out that amelia bones has been killed her brother and his wife were murdered in the first war what does voldemort have against this family  why target them  she did nt seem to be on dumbledore s side  in particular  when we saw her at harry s hearing  but i would imagine that a fair minded woman high up in the ministry would be a bit of a hindrance to voldemort in his rise to power once she saw evidence of his return  surely she would nt support him and anyone that was against him was pretty much dead  gt  the opposition leader talks about a grim mood gripping the country fudge confirms this later in this chapter that it is caused by the dementors so is there job just to walk around spreading misery for voldemort  why do nt they kiss more muggles  particularly since they ca nt see them  i do nt think its their job to walk around the country willynilly  but i took it to mean that the huge amount of them pretty much invading really made a difference even if they were just secluded to certain pockets  their numbers would probably have a noticeable effect  especially since there normally are nt any dementors outside of azkaban  gt  do you think former prime ministers in this world get together and discuss what they know of the magical world  i was thinking they would be obliviated once they leave office after all  it s not like everyone in politics knows about wizards  it s just them so at the very end of term  maybe on their last day  or maybe there is something like a passing of the torch where the outgoing prime minister introduces the <URL> prime minister to the minister of magic and then right after that meeting   obliviate  
846,harrypotter,i had previously heard that this chapter would have been in the chamber of secrets  but i m still unsure as to how  what would they discuss 
847,harrypotter,i m heavily considering getting a hp tattoo and i ve looked at a lot of images which ones are your favorites that you ve seen out there 
848,harrypotter,  <URL> here s mine  d not original at all and nothing really amazing about it but i love it and i have a story to tell to everyone who asks  btw if you get one be prepared to tell a lot of people that it s a harry potter tat cuz a lot of people are gon na ask 
849,harrypotter,the wiki page is still restricted 
850,harrypotter,as an employee there  i ca nt wait to get my first shift on a tech rehearsal day i ve done all my training and i m so excited help all you witches and wizards learn how to greet a hippogriff  the creative team worked so hard to bring this to life the detail is absolutely stunning i ve been on forbidden journey three times now and it is one of the best rides i ve ever been on i d <URL> following  micechat on twitter for updates on when tech rehearsals are happening 
851,harrypotter,or summon the objects in the room after the fiendfyre  or summon the room with the fiendfyre gone  the nature of the fiendfyre is magic and presumably while it can destroy magical objects  i m under the impression that one could transfigure ashes of a former object back into itself so that leaves my question  is it possible for the room of requirement to restore all the objects in the room of hidden things  minus any enchantments cast upon the objects  which i presume is nullified after being burned   additional questions   does the room of requirement  being of its own magic  have its own protections which the fiendfyre would nt affect   does the room of requirement  being that it can be multiple rooms  still exist despite the fiendfyre in the version of the room of requirement that is the room of hidden things  also  if the room of requirement still exists  does that mean the room of hidden things just the only thing destroyed   is the nature of the room of requirement an everlasting spell  meaning that as a type of magic and not a object  the fiendfyre would nt be able to destroy it   does the room of requirement have its own magic   why did nt the fiendfyre escape the room of requirement 
852,harrypotter,honestly i was always under the assumption that the ror itself was destroyed with the fiendfyre its really interesting to consider the alternative that  just  the room of hidden things was destroyed 
853,harrypotter,my thoughts are  that magical destruction is final much like avada kedavera once it s goneit s gone  i m not sure what precedent is set for returning magical artifacts from ashes  other than obviously a phoenix  so it really boils down too is the ror more magical than magical destruction  i believe no  however the ror could conjure a fairly detailed replication of the original item if it was wellneeded the original however would be destroyed 
854,harrypotter,i assume no  because the items were destroyed by magic it was nt normal fire  it was magical fire kind of like how george s ear ca nt be healed because it was magically cursed off 
855,harrypotter,the room of requirement ca nt summon any objects from the room of hidden things because its purpose of keeping things hiddenwhen hermione tries to summon the diadem in deathly hallows it didnt work now you could say that maybe  as a headcanon  that voldemort put an enchantment on the tiara so it ca nt be summonedbut that ca nt be true because voldemort did nt think that anyone would know about the room so what was the point  i do nt know what happened to the room of requirement after the fiendfyre ate all the objectsnothing in the books says anything about it afterward also the transfiguration part would require you to know what the object was before it burned to ashes so i do nt think they can as for summoning the objects  requesting the ror  back from the asheswe really do nt know the limits of the room s magic also fiendfyre is very dark magic so i do nt think it s likely the room can bring it back 
856,harrypotter,i love this so much  instant rush of feelings  i hope you so loved it
857,harrypotter,i always thought it was because nothing makes her happier than terrorizing nonpure bloods  and that is the happiness feeding her patronus
858,harrypotter,well fuck
859,harrypotter,good post  that man needed recognition
860,harrypotter,because molly wanted to account for all eventualities ron came home after first year saying hermione s parents were dentist  so molly added that strange dentist  place just in case ron went to visit  i m more curious about what prompted molly and arthur to include prison
861,harrypotter,arthur probably just heard it somewhere and included it out of excitement 
862,harrypotter,there are a couple inconsistencies about dentistry in the movies  for example  in diagon alley  there is a sign for  surgical and dental operator  as well i think it s just a movie thing though i do nt recall anything in the books indicating that wizards are familiar with mugglestyle dentistry 
863,harrypotter,movies do not equal books books are canon movies are not it s a small detail i think that would bypass the author s input 
864,harrypotter,arthur is obsessed with muggles 
865,harrypotter,because whoever created the clock has nt read the books  obviously 
866,harrypotter,how do we know it s not  if not  maybe they go to a muggle dentist 
867,harrypotter,bc movie
868,harrypotter,i always thought of them as a sinister version of the studio ghibli dust bunnies 
869,harrypotter,holy shit you could sell these  i would totally buy one shut up and take my money 
870,harrypotter,gt  oh this will be great a weasley clock that probably does nt even move let alone work s     gt  that is literally the coolest thing i have ever seen it actually  works  just like magic

875,harrypotter,so what s the requirement for the clock to light  mortal peril   a panic button on the phone  heartbeat measurer  any fastfood place 
876,harrypotter,while this is awesome  and truly a great design feat i feel i should mention that  in my experience  those location based ifttt triggers deplete cell phone battery very quickly ymmv
877,harrypotter,brilliant mind 
878,harrypotter,holy fucking shit you sir are amazing  and i do nt think i have been this impressed all year  2016   i will throw in another resounding  sell these and make tons of money  because i would buy 10 i m wondering if i could somehow get my electrician friends and my engineering friends together could they help me make one of these my mom would love this she does nt know a thing about harry potter  but she always wants to know where everyone is and what they re doing

916,harrypotter,people die in this tournament  is a great title for the askaban movie if it was clickbait 
917,harrypotter,i ve worked in box offices in professional theaters and we usually allow the ticket holder to call the box office and request that the tickets be left in someone else s name all they would have to do is come to the box office and state their name every theater is different  but if you can find someone to take the tickets it should be easy for the other party to pick the tickets up my theater also allowed people to switch nights for a fee i would call the theater and explain the situation and hopefully they can give you some options 
918,harrypotter,the wiki page and the sidebar still mention monday night quaffles posts  but i have nt seen one of those in a while 
919,harrypotter,beech wood  12 34 in  unicorn hair
920,harrypotter,to account for the activities of her husband researching and policing things that wizards are not supposed to be involved with is his job 
921,harrypotter,i m sort of in the same boat  i have tix but i ca nt use all of them as some unforseen financial difficulties have come up for some of my group as i m sure you probably know  nimax wants anyone who needs to sell  return tickets to use their wishlist  return system basically  you must call them  depending on who you purchased from  nimax  0343 20<SMILE> 0500 or atg  0<SMILE>44 412 6600  local  020 7206 11<SMILE>2  intntl   and inform them that you would like to register your tickets for return they will then attempt to match up your tickets to people who have registered on the wishlist  there is  however  no guarantee that your tickets will sell if they do nt  tough tit for you there s also a charge of  250 per refunded ticket  i posted earlier  asking if anyone had any experience with this wishlist  return system  but no one responded  so i do nt know if the system is actually working i m still hoping to find friends to pass the tickets to  so have nt registered mine yet  if you do use the system  please post to let us know what your experience was like 
922,harrypotter,ujecsgirl
923,harrypotter,this guy should really think about doing a kickstarter so many people would want this  not only us harry potter fans it s just cool technology allaround 
924,harrypotter,this is unreal amazing job 
925,harrypotter,my jaw just dropped 
926,harrypotter,oh my god i will pay you to make me one  lol
927,harrypotter,it s absolutely amazing  you could definitely sell these  even though i expect they would be quite expensive if hand made seriously my muggle house needs it 
928,harrypotter,dumbledore s worst trait is his ruthlessness towards his own followers and leniency towards death eaters he sacrificed so many of his own  good people  bones  mckinnons  potters  longbottoms  while offering those raping  torturing murderers endless second chances  despite his own considerable power  he never got his hands dirty  because he wanted his soul complete for the next great adventure as a result  hundreds  if not thousands  were tortured and murdered by death eaters many more were traumatized  and a whole generation doomed to child soldiers  this man was an epic failure 
929,harrypotter,wish each person got a clock hand like in the films  but this is pretty darn close reimagination  did you have forest set to leisure or is it actually the forest  lol
930,harrypotter,the halfblood prince print out is one of my favorite artistic interpretations for that i ve seen nearly gave me goosebumps i even counted the pieces and  yes  there are seven 
931,harrypotter,amazimg  well done

933,harrypotter,i m on book 5 and it really seems like that was a glaring oversight and the most that people tell harry is   do nt lose your temper 
934,harrypotter,i think that s part of the role of head of house it s never explicitly stated  but it seems like they re the person to go to if a student has a problem 
935,harrypotter,so  like  why is it the  philosopher s stone  and not the  sorcerer s stone  
936,harrypotter,why 
937,harrypotter,i have no idea what is going on here these were posted outside a local small theater no other information was posted

955,harrypotter,i ve been relistening to the harry potter series during delivery driving at work and i just finished  the order of the phoenix  again it must have been the most depressing feeling for harry  when he finally opened sirius  present at the end  realizing that he could have communicated with him so much easier and possibly prevented his death with it so sad and i had another reminder how snape could have prevented it all  by actually trying to teach harry occlumency and not giving up 
956,harrypotter,harry was nt practicing as much as he should have and he was very curious about the visions voldemort was sending the blame goes both ways here 
957,harrypotter,the part where he finds the mirror breaks my heart every time  if only he had opened the present when he d received it i really wish they had included that scene in the movie  especially since the mirror plays such a vital role in book 7   but it probably did nt seem too significant at the time  just a sad detail 
958,harrypotter,this is my first post  ca nt wait to be apart of the wonderful world you guys have made here  i first read the series probably five or more years ago  but i ve been rereading them over the past six months or so  and i m always impressed by jk s literary prowess  i just finished  goblet of fire   and i wanted to share an example with you guys of foreshadowing  three whole books in advance   that i only realized my third pass through the book this is the scene towards the end of the book in which dumbledore is questioning harry about what happened in the graveyard it s the part where harry tells dumbledore and sirius about wormtail taking his blood  695696   gt  when harry told of wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger  however  sirius let out a vehement exclamation and dumbledore stood up so quickly that harry started dumbledore walked around the desk and told harry to stretch out his arm harry showed them both the place where his robes were torn and the cut beneath them  gt   he said my blood would make him stronger than if he d used someone else s   harry told dumbledore  he said the protection my  my mother left in me  he d have it too and he was right  he could touch me without hurting himself  he touched my face  gt  for a fleeting instant  harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in dumbledore s eyes but next second  harry was sure he had imagined it  for when dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk  he looked as old and weary as harry had ever seen him  i m fairly sure that  triumph  is foreshadowing for the end of  deathly hallows  where dumbledore explains to harry that  by taking harry s blood  voldemort keeps harry alive even in his death it s only one sentence  and it s buried pretty deeply in the fourth book  but it shows not only jk s concrete knowledge of the future of the plot  but also dumbledore s knowledge of harry s future and the hope that voldemort s arrogance has created  the books are riddled  ha  with all sorts of examples like this  and they really do show how well jk had the story laid out years ahead of time as a fan rereading the series  these are the little details that make you glad you chose to read again  edit  formatting
959,harrypotter,there are quite a few moments like this  voldemort tells his death eaters that he has traveled further along the path to immortality than any other wizard  which is a clear hint at his experimentation with horcruxes 
960,harrypotter,absolutely  i m sure that dumbledore could not think of any way to get harry through this alive when he heard what voldemort had done  it must have been a great wave of relief 
961,harrypotter,it is also interesting to note how this passage foreshadows dumbledore s story line in future books up until this moment harry sees dumbledore as this infallible perfect god who always knows what to do and always has the right answer to all the issues as described in previous books and the beginning of fourth book this comes as a contrast to the fact that he is one of the people he thinks of after he has the dream at the beginning about voldemort killing frank bryce  he is the one he runs when he sees mad crouch and he is the one he wants to talk to after witnessing voldemort torturing wormtail  however the fact that he is tired and concerned shows us how human he actually is the glimpse of triumph of course indicates that he is as lucid and intelligent as always with very strong deductive skills but from now on he would proceed to make severe mistakes in book five  by choosing to keep harry and sirius out of the loop  he indirectly is responsible for sirius s death not to mention book six where we truly get to see a weakened dumbledore as he is dying from a curse which he accidentally put on himself it all culminates with book seven where we learn about his past  his involvement with grindelwald and his part in the death of his sister 
962,harrypotter,i remember reading that and wondering about it i was thinking  why did he have that look  what was he thinking   i am so happy you made this post o grade for you 
963,harrypotter,yeah  that is an awesome moment i really love rereading  or listening to  the books and picking up on hints like that one that are woven throughout the series another great foreshadowing moment is the scene in order of the phoenix  after harry has the vision of mr weasley being attacked  and they re in dumbledore s office   dumbledore watched the smoke closely  his brow furrowed  and after a few seconds  the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the aira serpent s head grew out of the end of it  opening its mouth wide harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story  he looked eagerly at dumbledore for a sign that he was right  but dumbledore did not look up  naturally  naturally  murmured dumbledore apparently to himself  still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise but in essence divided   harry could make neither head nor tail of this question the smoke serpent  however  split itself instantly into two snakes  both coiling and undulating in the dark air with a look of grim satisfaction dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand  the clinking noise slowed and died  and the smoke serpents grew faint  became a formless haze  and vanished    ootp pg 470 in the american edition  this was most likely dumbledore working out his theory that a piece of voldemort s soul was living in harry i ve always wondered at what  exact  point in the series dumbledore realized and admitted to himself that harry had to die in order for voldemort to be defeated  and to see if his behavior towards harry changed at all as a result but i guess if he figured out in book four that voldemort s act of taking harry s blood might mean an ultimate triumph for him  it would nt have affected him as much so many questions   also  <URL> to rharrypotter  i m incredibly new here as well and am so glad i finally found this place 
964,harrypotter,yep the first one i saw on my first run on the books is when trelawney has her real prediction in front of harry when harry reports it to dumbledore  he says something like   that s her second real prophecy  harry did not inquire what was the first one  which was revealed only on the 5th book 
965,harrypotter,i was literally reading this part last night and thought the exact same thing great find   the best thing about rereading the series is that you pick up small details like this each time i ve just finished gof for the fourth time now and i ve found some new small detail like this every time  you have to admire jk s thought process when writing these books  she clearly had the whole thing planned out very well these small hints are evidence of that 
966,harrypotter,this is making me want to reread them all again i only finished them for the 6th time a few months ago lol also  i chuckled out loud at the  riddled  pun   well done  golf clap 
967,harrypotter,i have a doubt here why did the expression change from concern to triumph  i get the triumph  part but why the concern  
968,harrypotter,that s a crazy good catch i reread them over summer last year and i caught a ton of stuff but this one escaped me nice job
969,harrypotter,when i first read dh s king cross chapter i had a  ahha  moment to the triumph look    this was probably the most talked about moment during the long summer  period between gof and ootp   well second most talked about after shipping of course i think some fans even asked jkr about it during a qamp  a session but she could nt give an answer  the fact i still remember it while reading dh for the first time in 2007 shows you how big it was 
970,harrypotter,this one is nt nearly as monumental as the foreshadowing you mentioned but one of the instances of foreshadowing i always though was cool was madam rosmerta in hbp right before the part where katie bell is almost killed by the necklace harry  ron  and hermione are in the 3 broomsticks and ron is looking around trying to catch a glimpse of madam rosmerta hermione asks ron what he s looking for and ron says  nothing   hermione responds with something to the effect of  i expect nothing s in the back getting more firewhiskey   in reality though she was already under malfoy s imperius curse in the woman s restroom waiting for a hogwarts student to give the necklace too 
971,harrypotter,well  yeah 
972,harrypotter,i feel like snape would have preferred it stayed the lily crepe 
973,harrypotter,i grew up right down the street from that bakery i moved away <SMILE> months ago for college and now my heart hurts  
974,harrypotter,does it taste like bitterness and regret 
975,harrypotter,i bet it has 394 calories 
976,harrypotter,god  i keep forgetting we lost him and it hurts my heart every time 
977,harrypotter,snep crepe
978,harrypotter,i live less than a mile from there 
979,harrypotter,too bad they misspelled pensieve 
980,harrypotter,where s the actual crepe 
981,harrypotter,i love that place i wish i still lived in boston so i could go there  
982,harrypotter,i live right around the corner from this restaurant   i know where i m going for brunch next week 
983,harrypotter,snape snape severus snape

998,harrypotter,so it s basically rhp quidditch but for everyone  let the stalking commence 
999,harrypotter,ujecsgirl
1000,starwars,he died for our spins 
1001,starwars,i do nt think he necessarily knows that has any connection to luke though pretty sure he just interprets it as rey s own internalization of her isolation and loneliness in her dreams she probably does too  because i m assuming she was having those dreams before she even heard that luke and the jedi actually exist 
1002,starwars,both times i saw it  it seemed to me that meant that she had been on the island with him before  as a child for that to be true would mean that luke was nt  hunting  for the island  but already knew where it was i m fine with that logic for now  since he may have wanted to keep it a secret wow  maybe he found her there 
1003,starwars,the tie fighters flying over was a nice touch  well done 
1004,starwars,they sure did    youtubeqds6re3hgo
1005,starwars,this is awesome but it is missing the sick spins 
1006,starwars,awesome  really well made
1007,starwars,brains would nt have to be slow roasted they re quite tender as is i would suggest a slow braise for the legs  grind the arms and shoulder for stormtrooperloaf and just make soup out of the rest  my god  what did i just write 
1008,starwars,the book aftermath pretty much confirmed it through one of the characters accounts of endor 
1009,starwars,you ca nt look into the dead hatefilled eyes of those godless killing machines  and not see the soul of a monster yeah they ate those bodies  then made ornaments from their skulls 
1010,starwars,in one of the new comics  there s a bit where a rebel soldier asks what kind of meat he s eating during the celebration after the battle of endor we never see the answer  but i feel like the comic s writer knew what he was doing 
1011,starwars,is there a wellorganized list  bonus points for some kind of infographic  of all the newcanon comics  the issues released  storylines that cut across  etc 
1012,starwars,darth vader  20 sounds awesome 
1013,starwars,had no idea poe was getting a comic
1014,starwars,i did nt realize that anakin amp  obiwan was just a miniseries dang 
1015,starwars,looking forward to that bonus triplezero and beetee story  meanwhile  come discuss this and more over at <URL>
1016,starwars,i need mo poe april ca nt get here soon enoughthat cover art alone has got me freaking out 
1017,starwars,the emperors guards look so cool it s a shame we do nt see more of them in the films 
1018,starwars,luke dual wielding his fathers and his from rotj would be pretty sweet 
1019,starwars,cant  agree with anyone here who wants luke to just use the force and not get involved in any lightsaber battles i totally want to see luke wield that green lightsaber again and go full retard on his enemies like he did in rotj but having said that  i also do nt want him to wield two lightsabers like the op does i do nt want anyone to wield two i do nt subscribe to that whole more is better  philosophy it just looks stupid to me  not badass 
1020,starwars,does nt luke throw his green one away at the end of rotj  like once he disarms vader  literally  and turns to the emperor he throws it and we never see him pick it up does he retrieve it or was it blown up with the death star 
1021,starwars,i d like it if luke was so powerful with the force that he does nt use a lightsaber he does nt need one 
1022,starwars,yeah  that would be really cool i d like to see both skywalker lightsabers in use by luke  and i think a double bladed saber would suit rey a lot better  gt   in a modified version of this  we see luke has mastered the force to the extent that he can change the lightsaber crystal s force properties at will  allowing him to suddenly ignite the two sabers into matching colors  meh  i do nt really like the sound of that too much it d just be too i do nt know i guess it d just be a little unnecessary and besides  are nt kyber crystals naturally colored as opposed to being colored by the force  it d also feel kinda wrong seeing anakin s or luke s lightsaber change colors after so many years of them being bluegreen 
1023,starwars,not sure if already been discussed but  what if we get a scene in ep <SMILE> or even 9  where luke is fighting with both his lightsabers   i think that would be insane to see luke do that with the contrasting color lightsabers  and it would be a great call back to anakin doing that  i d like it if rey uses anakin s saber to begin her training  but when she completes her own saber  it is returned to luke  i imagine the climatic battle involving rey with a doublestaff saber and luke using the blue and green  fighting all the remaining knights of ren simultaneously   in a modified version of this  we see luke has mastered the force to the extent that he can change the lightsaber crystal s force properties at will  allowing him to suddenly ignite the two sabers into matching colors 
1024,starwars,it would have been cool in rotj  but luke is the yoda role now  i d be ok i he did nt even use a lightsaber
1025,starwars,i ve thought about that it would be so badass
1026,starwars,my body is nt ready for this 
1027,starwars,i hope that rey has a decent amount of training and her own lightsaber already built by the start of episode <SMILE>  preferably a doublebladed one as a nod to her staff a fight with rey and luke back to back against the knights of ren led by kylo would be sick if it happens i hope they have a confident kylo and his knights do some badass stuff to signify his progression and vindicate the  little bitch  rep he kind of has that would be some good character development
1028,starwars,not the younglings
1029,starwars,interesting that actually fits with the fact there s talks of hayden christiansen doing a cameo as vader in the next film  which is also said to be a lot darker   very good speculation op 
1030,starwars,i would be okay with this oddly 
1031,starwars,that would be awesome
1032,starwars,more importantly  what is <URL> 
1033,starwars,i think snoke darth plagious  sp    <URL>   <URL>   vignette2wikianocookienetstarwarsimages005darthplagueiscoverjpgrevisionlatestthumbnaildownwidth340height340  cb  20110713215940
1034,starwars,if it s not porkins  this would be ok  but it s totally porkins    <URL>
1035,starwars,goddamn it that would be really fucking cool
1036,starwars,tomorrow s news   episode viii delayed for rewrites 
1037,starwars,you know what bothered me by that scene  not the killing of younglings  but the fact that every single kid was a human  not a single alien 
1038,starwars,betrayed  forgotten  abandoned every journey begins with a single step and this is step one    
1039,starwars,checks out 
1040,starwars,honestly  my prediction is that snoke will turn out to be like 3 inches tall like  this dude     <URL>   we ve only seen holographic images of him so far  after all 
1041,starwars,reminds me of  this robot chicken star wars sketch     <URL>  v  kzw727ryig  lol
1042,starwars,let me tell you a secret kids i ll tell you who snoke is  snoke is snoke 
1043,starwars,i can imagine it now  snoke with the first order army behind him  master skywalker there are too many of us  what are you going to do  
1044,starwars,the window  sweet  darth glassius 
1045,starwars,at this point i ll just take anything that is nt darth jar jar 
1046,starwars,the problem with involving luke in major lightsaber battles is that mark hamil is old and out of shape in the prequels they cgi d dooku and palpatine s head on a stun worker s body  and it was awkward and weird  if luke fights i d hope it would be more of a  through the force  kind of way like maybe he d just like use the force to force a room full of storm troopers onto their knees 
1047,starwars,but i want it now
1048,starwars,press announcement confirms gt  new cast members will include academy award winner benicio del toro  academy award nominee laura dern  and talented <URL> kelly marie tran    <URL>  cmp  smc  36<SMILE>071963amp  linkid  21276<SMILE>43
1049,starwars,holy fuuuuuuck
1050,starwars, lukes  incredible face  confirmed
1051,starwars,that got me more excited than it had any right to  i m thinking luke is going to flip some shit when he realizes what kylo has done kylo is in for one hell of a spanking 
1052,starwars,the first 45 minutes of episode <SMILE> will be a stone stair building tutorial with luke and rey
1053,starwars,shit  obama should just nominate mark hamill to the supreme court this movie could nt get any more hyped than that 
1054,starwars,luke looks so tired and torn up  soulwise i love the setup for this and i like that they continue right where they left off  instead of doing a six month fastforward 
1055,starwars,  <URL>
1056,starwars,the chills 
1057,starwars,also from this i can probably gather <SMILE> leads straight on from 7  not like a 5 year gap 
1058,starwars,we get a teaser for episode viii before rogue one very interesting 
1059,starwars,should have gone with qtkt without getting into the malefemaleandrogynous debate circlejerk  bb<SMILE> definitely had the personality of a child and that would have annoyed the shit out of r2d2
1060,starwars,if harrison ford saw it  would he say  snakes  why did it have to be snakes  
1061,starwars,sebulba threatening a fett   chesko sebulba 
1062,starwars,oh swg how i miss you   
1063,starwars,makes me wonder what happened to all anakin s friends  yes i know one of them is greedo who he assaults for disagreeing with him on a single issue  
1064,starwars,although  unless you are a hutt  anywhere on tatooine is essentially  different degree of slum 
1065,starwars,an unbalanced composition unfortunately everything seems fairly monochromatic on the left three quarters of the image  but then you have the bright white  neon  sign and the stark blues  greens and pure red in only the bottom righthand corner 
1066,starwars,does she hate you 
1067,starwars,you should marry her  it s so sweet she took five minutes out if her day to make this for you 
1068,starwars,<URL>
1069,starwars,jesus  anakin really fucked that kid up 
1070,starwars,honestly do think he might be a fallen jedi with an obsession with vader the only info we got him is that he s  seen the rise of the empire 
1071,starwars, crikey  one of the little buggers is peeking out from under the xwing the other one is curled up nice and warm in the log what a pair of little bewdys   great job op  enriching your pets environment and doing it star wars style  very nice 
1072,starwars,endorwith a swamped xwingendor  seriously  op  not dagobah 
1073,starwars,may the force be with you  paul always 
1074,starwars,i m very sorry to hear that it was nice to see all of the support he got from everyone before he died i hope the people that helped him will support his family in the same way  it s a shame that he will never see episodes viii and xi  
1075,starwars,very nicely done op  fyi  these paintings are part of a set of landscapes of the north east states of the us completed in 1956 by the littleknown but highlyregarded landscape painter  robert wood     enwikipediaorgwikirobert_william_wood   his impressionist style was immediately appreciated and continued until well after his death in 1979 at auction  in mint condition  they can fetch in excess of  40000 
1076,starwars,make it red because she turns to the dark side i mean look at the main star wars poster   <URL> it already looks like she s using a red doubleblade also notice how all the evil people are on teh left side of the poster in red and all teh good people are on teh right side in blue
1077,starwars,that looks disgusting
1078,starwars,so crazy to think of a space station with its own atmosphere 
1079,starwars,god starkiller base is just  so  cool
1080,starwars,that s no moon 
1081,starwars,lol  the ending really got me 
1082,starwars,nice  although this makes the whole base look constructed like the death stars  when the stuff around the edges of the cannonarea should just be snowcovered it was nt completely metal and lights all the way around 
1083,starwars,i was hoping lebron was going to be the jedi and johnny manziel was kylo ren
1084,starwars,love it not sure about the practicalities of a staffsaber  but that s exactly how i imagine hers to turn out 
1085,starwars,i feel if you re going to have this style saber  only make it one sided  when divided like that and the saber part being that short it looks awkward
1086,starwars,did you see his incredible face  
1087,starwars,just like every bit of news we got about tfa  this announcement makes me want to run around making xwing noises 
1088,starwars,kit fisto has always been one of my favorite jedi i wish we saw more of him in the movies but holy shit he is a badass in tcw
1089,starwars,on season 4 of clone wars currently i ve always liked the look of the character but this show is quickly making him one of my favorites good job 
1090,starwars,  enwikipediaorgwikisoul_man_  2<SMILE>film  29
1091,starwars,  youtubewl15etrcasg
1092,starwars,can not unsee
1093,starwars,just let your souuuulululuull glowwwwwww
1094,starwars,in between the 70 s vest  the firearm pose and the afro  he looks like he s in a distastefully allwhite blacksploitation film 
1095,starwars,i actually prefer this  
1096,starwars,that ca nt really be true  no clone would shoot a jedi without order prior to order 66  they physically ca nt besides that  obi wan would have easily defeated a clone trooper
1097,starwars,calm down  satan 
1098,starwars,you may have gone a little too far in a few places    <URL>
1099,starwars,obi wan is such a damn liar 
1100,starwars,i personally would love to see luke back in red 5 at some point  maybe flying as leader in a huge battle before landing for a ground assault  imagine seeing all those sleek new xwings with poe and the gang and up front is luke in his old school xwing flying point i know now that hes wise old master  its incredibly unlikely but i think that would be dope  how about you  what would you love to see happen that probably wont 
1101,starwars,finally seeing luke as a jedi master  and everything that s included with that 
1102,starwars,some actual knights of ren action  please 
1103,starwars,anakin s force ghost maybe as a way to make kylo ren s redemption arc happen  and there will probably be a redemption arc because star wars is disney now  
1104,starwars,at first glance  i thought it looked like the geonosian queen 
1105,starwars, to compare     wwwtelegraphcoukcontentdamfilmstarwarsforceawakensmazxlargejpg 
1106,starwars,  aotc spoiler warning    duh so  when jango fett gets killed by windu  my friend asked  so  that s not him right    confused  i ask him what he means  well  he had like 1 million clones of himself  so the one that just died could just be some random clone  i think that theory is pretty cool and i personally never thought about something like that  even though the movie has an entire clone army of him it would be something very incharacter of jango to do it would also explain why he died so clumsily  when he s supposed to be one of the best bounty hunters in the business  able to kill jedi  another reason i love this theory is want to see some more jango fett maybe he could show up in the potential boba fett movie  or maybe his own  i think it d be pretty dope 
1107,starwars,so he just abandoned boba  well  i guess you ca nt be a bounty hunter and father of the year at the same time 
1108,starwars,gt  it would also explain why he died so clumsily like father  like son   definitely a fun theory  though 
1109,starwars,that is a fucking cool theory buy your friend a blue milk on me
1110,starwars,hold me when i open like a flower 
1111,starwars,probably not until ix  but one thing i desperately want to see is a jedi straight out beat a sith in an even light vs dark fight obiwan beat anakin because of anakin s hubris  luke beat vader by channeling his hatred i suppose mace windu beat paplatine but it s arguable that palpatine did that intentionally  judging by how yoda  about as powerful as mace  could nt really do much to him later  we constantly get to see how badass the sith are  but outside of one poorlychoreographed  tensionless fight  we have never seen an enlightened  awesome jedi lay down justice luke and rey vs a dozen knights of ren  or just an even rey vs ren  without rey tapping into the dark side like luke did  would be great 
1112,starwars,um  excuse me  just letting you know i ll be taking these now thank you you ve been most kind  o0
1113,starwars,rplates
1114,starwars, is he a relative of yours  do you know who he s talking abo   what is happening to your face  what did i do      
1115,starwars,an epic lightsaber battle between luke and kylo ren with the knights of ren 
1116,starwars,all i can see is that his face suddenly <URL> darker on one side 
1117,starwars,i really want to see the body horror element of the dark side of the force being developed more we know what it s possible for those strong in the force to lift people and crush their airways  but we have nt seen limbs broken  helmets crushed  hearts stopped  etc i m hoping snoke gets the chance to establish himself apart as a true monster by ditching force lightning and light sabers in favor of a more savage and brutal approach to forcewielding 
1118,starwars,very cool
1119,starwars,ewan was such a good choice for obiwan  i could barely notice the difference 
1120,starwars,a large capital ship battle 
1121,starwars,its an external representation of his emotions man  this got me 
1122,starwars,luke being a bad ass 
1123,starwars,i had a thought about luke in his old xwing  that s probably the ship he took to achto so what if while training rey  luke senses that things are not going well for the resistance he and rey realize they need to head back to help rey and chewie take the falcon and luke and r2 take the xwing  meanwhile poe and company are in dire straights back at the resistance base there s tie fighters everywhere and they think all is lost until out of no where the falcon and an old t65 xwing show up and proceed to clean up the first order fighters poe sees the old xwing making impossible shots and doing things even he did nt know an xwing could do poe says  that s a hell of a pilot  with the same level of awe that finn did poe thanks him and asks who he is over the radio you hear  this is luke skywalker  cue resistance cheering like crazy 
1124,starwars,george lucas  is that you 
1125,starwars,i think snoke simply corrupted a young impressionable ben the dark side is the quick  easy  and attractive path it s supposed to be tempting and i hope that they use the explanation of ben s fall to add to snoke s development as a formidable and manipulative figure  anakin s the only skywalker to fall like ben has fallen and he had a mentor pushing him down that path the whole way i think ben will turn out to be the same way they can add a catalyst for the fall but i d like it to be mostly snoke we need more snoke
1126,starwars,gt  so why do skywalkers go bad only 40  of skywalkers go bad shmi  good anakin  bad luke  good leia  good ben  bad
1127,starwars,this has 250 up votes 
1128,starwars,i want to see rey and luke communicate with past jedi by sitting and meditating and leaving the physical world they ll have an out of body experience where the spirits of the deceased will use their powers to explore a force vision  showing them the origins of snoke and giving them a glimpse of the road ahead mostly  i just want more metaphysical content 
1129,starwars,those are some pimp plates
1130,starwars,the way i saw it in rotj  luke was there because he wanted to save his father  not to confront palpatine luke tries to convince vader to return to the light on yavin  but vader basically says it s too late for him and takes him to the emperor luke does nt attack the emperor until after being goaded  edit  basically  luke was gambling that he could turn his father away from the dark side he may also have been there to try and kill palpatine and vader if the attack failed 
1131,starwars,definitely thought that c3p0 was bubbles from trailer park boys at first glance cool plates though 
1132,starwars,luckyyyyy
1133,starwars,  <URL>
1134,starwars,i m going to japan for 2 weeks in the beginning of april bringing a whole extra suitcase for all the crap i know i m going to buy  which will likely include many random star wars things 
1135,starwars,dude  where in japan can i get these 
1136,starwars,so you went to japan to buy some china 
1137,starwars,this is so fucking cool  ca nt imagine how excited she must be right now 
1138,starwars, gets excited   remembers it s coming december 2017  fuck 
1139,starwars,you can buy them from  loft        a chain grocery store locating everywhere i bought them from a star wars exhibition last year  and my favorite is this necklace   <URL>
1140,starwars,  <URL>
1141,starwars,that stormtrooper plate is bothering me in a ocd like way other than that  those plates are awesome 
1142,starwars,this character has always amused me so much juhani is a male name in finland 
1143,starwars,luke s plan was  as i understand it  to either turn his father from the dark side and escape with him after killing palpatine together  or sacrifice himself to keep them on the second death star when the rebels blow it up either way  the reasoning goes  the rebellion wins 
1144,starwars,two things  1  no helicopter shot at the end end on luke s  i ve seen some shit  face 2  kylo does nt remove his helmet for rey he waits until han approaches him on the catwalk
1145,starwars,i would have replaced maz with leia and had her give some explanation of the force to rey something similar to the yoda line about  it flows through us binds us  feel it luminance beings are we not this  so that rey had at least some explanation for how she all of the sudden knew how to tap into it for the first time in her life i can see leia being hans connection to the resistance that he s reluctant to contact working out pretty well and feel like it would be a cool role for her  i go back and forth on this one but i would have had kylo ren take his helmet off for the first time on the catwalk with han i also would have given him a different haircut  i thought the curls made him less intimidating  also i would have had the resistance send bigger ships to starkiller base to help get the xwings through the fo fleet they would nt have to show a big capital ship battle scene or anything but it would have made the resistance actually look like they were being funded by a legitimate government  would have distanced that battle from the first death star a little and made more sense to me personally 
1146,starwars,yeah to me the end scene just comes off as an awkward silence to me  if i was either character in that situation i would dread having to break that suffocating silence 
1147,starwars,small change  get ride of the part where han shoots a trooper without even looking  big change  get rid of the starkiller base  or  since it is a planet  put innocent life on it now destroying the base <URL> more of a moral dilemma
1148,starwars,i would have made the drone camera spin around more and for longer  smartassery aside  it s not a star wars ending  it s a new kind of ending the original ending was rey looking at chewy in the cockpit of the falcon and jamming the throttle forward so they jumped into lightspeed on the way to find luke in the next movie 
1149,starwars,make it end with a line from either luke or rey something like  hello there little friend  from luke in obiwan style  or the conformation of the obvious rey confronts luke  he turns around  removes his hood  looks at her  and says   rey search your feelings i m your father  end
1150,starwars,they have a lot of force potential the greater potential for power  the greater chance of being corrupted 
1151,starwars,seems like landowedge and han were going to blow dsii up anyway did all that drama with luke and vader really matter in the very end 
1152,starwars,i love your kotor art dude never stop 
1153,starwars,calling it now lara dern is going today be chased by a rancor then she is going to stick her hand in a big pile of bantha poodoo 
1154,starwars,that s pretty rad god  i ca nt imagine how exciting this is for her 
1155,starwars,i m pretty sure dooku was very strong in both the force and in saber combat just looking at the movies  basically the holy scripture of canon   he was able to defeat obiwan  who we should remember was not a shabby duelist himself  and an immature anakin 2v1 he was then able to hold his own against yoda for an extended period of time later  he defeated obiwan again before eventually falling to anakin  he also received direct training by the two greatest force users of his time  yoda and palpatine 
1156,starwars,he was pretty damn powerful one of the best lightsaber wielders no doubt  as he took on a ton of jedi during the clone wars also clearly powerful with the force taking on yoda he was also the leader of the separatists  which gave him tremendous political power 
1157,starwars,before we saw him duel in aotc  i kinda got the vibe that even with mace windu threatening him with a saber  he was nt too concerned  even if jango did nt intervene  about his well being  i mean the first saber duel we ever see  he effortlessly cuts down obiwan and anakin  even in rots  he held his own against a much more powerful anakin amp  obiwan  until anakin had to physically overpowered him 
1158,starwars,i d change the  traitor  trooper to be captain phasma it just makes so much more sense to me plus it would ve made cp an actual cool character
1159,starwars,very much agreed the aerial  circular shot felt odd and a little too modern for a sw flick they should ve at least held the shot of rey holding up the lightsaber to luke with the landscape in the back and freeze it  all the endings from the other movies had a landscape painting composition before closing in with the credits 
1160,starwars,i do nt like this thread the ending was the best part of the movie for me oh well opinions 
1161,starwars,it s pretty awesome that kelly was cast in episode viii i d seen collegehumor skits featuring her before the announcement it feels insane  congrats to her then  and congratulations to you op  one of your friends is in a star wars movie i would imagine in a couple of years that would be like being friends with carrie fisher or  to an extent  daisy ridley shit s legendary
1162,starwars,i worked with kelly at a horrible 95 job in la an old coworker of ours got a similar text and he and i spent the night speculating not sure why  but i thought she was involved in a major crime but was just being cheeky about it so much happier to hear that star wars was the big news this is huge for her could not be more excited 
1163,starwars,another thing i ve seen no one mention is that he s the only person we see in the movies and tcw that can use sith lightning other than palpatine i imagine that takes an impressive understanding of the force  let alone the dark side
1164,starwars, source     <URL> 
1165,starwars,it s very lovely great choice of colors with the pink and the stark lighting i appreciate that the balance seems to work 
1166,starwars, horizon  star wars dawn     enwikipediaorgwikihorizon_zero_dawn 
1167,starwars,looks nice but now the neck is extremely exposed and its even more top heavy 
1168,starwars,finn and poe land in the goazan badlands according to an imperial officer in the movie  i noticed how different they look in comparison to the game  which has rocky canyons  i m thinking all the dust storms jakku likely had drastically changed the landscape  just something small i noticed 
1169,starwars,he looks like he s constipated
1170,starwars,tbh was expecting to see anakin here but saw ben and made me realise how similar they are in terms of emotions perhaps ben was put into luke s jedi academy late in his childhood like anakin making ben have all his emotions uncontrollable  just like anakin 
1171,starwars,pretty close to evolving into a 40k titan lol
1172,starwars,badass 
1173,starwars,caml
1174,starwars,mark really seems to enjoy twitter
1175,starwars,that s why i love twitter
1176,starwars,the funny thing is that he hates the beard he referred to it as his contractually obligated beard and he shaved it off as soon as he was able 
1177,starwars,30 years from now they will be telling their grandchildren of this great moment in their life 
1178,starwars, vanity  i ca nt help it i used to be a poster boy when i was a kid i was the first one ever to be signed up for the resistance  they were so proud of me the face of poe they called me 
1179,starwars,now that s one helluva poster boy 
1180,starwars,ii legit need this poster neeeeed it 
1181,starwars,i love these
1182,starwars,he appears slightly crosseyed 
1183,starwars, mudhole  slimy  my home this is    yoda
1184,starwars,artwork by  variones     <URL>  
1185,starwars,but i thought mos eisley was the most  wretched hive of scum and villainy   this looks worse 
1186,starwars,this looks worse than shmi and anakin s home 
1187,starwars,awesome  all it needs is someone selling moisture 
1188,starwars,this great man
1189,starwars,artwork by  daniel reyes     <URL>  
1190,starwars, not today sarlacc   boba fett  19<SMILE>3 
1191,starwars,it s amazing how he got out with his armor all perfectly intact and shiny like that
1192,starwars,would nt it be funny of the reason he was beaten so easily was because he was drunk  of course we know thats not true but thinking about that makes me laugh 
1193,starwars,the beak always confuses me 
1194,starwars,where did you get the background 
1195,starwars,death star 3
1196,starwars,that s some high quality rbeards content there 
1197,starwars,that s so nice of her  happy birthday  
1198,starwars,i used to enjoy twitter but now i ca nt really find anything interesting on it
1199,starwars,ttake em  take em down ddo yer  do yer stuff 
1200,starwars,its really old and  apparently people have a lot of problems with resolutions and stuff but  i ve never played it before  and i hear its very very good 
1201,starwars,he s faved two of my tweets to him recently he s a lovely man  so happy to be who he is and have done what he has done i love him  luke was my hero as a kid  and now he faved my tweet so cool 
1202,starwars,as unoriginal as it may have been  death star 3    it still looks so fucking cool and is an interesting concept 
1203,starwars,is that fruit by the foot  
1204,starwars,why are there imperial shuttles 
1205,starwars,you re on twitter and reddit  tr<SMILE>r 
1206,starwars,thumbs up  ten points to gryffindor 
1207,starwars,very nice the geek in me notes the end of that blaster rifle should be sliced off 
1208,starwars,he s liked three of mine  always fun to have it happen  glad to see he enjoys fan interaction 
1209,starwars, this is not the update that i had hoped to write  but i am here to let you know that star wars fan paul giesbrecht  whom i posted about before  passed away this valentine s day after a long battle with cancer   original post     <URL>   first update     <URL>   second update     <URL>  in previous posts  i talked about how paul had been doing since reddit raised about  4000 to go toward his family s expenses a lot has happened since then  paul was even contacted by lucasfilm and jj abrams  who offered their encouragement it was a bigger response than they could have hoped for paul and his wife were able to see the force awakens and had a great time going thank you so much to all of you who have supported them  since that time paul took a turn for the worse a blockage appeared in his intestine and he became unable to eat  first the plain foods he had been subsisting on  then the protein and meal replacement shakes became impossible for him to digest the combination of the cancer and the inability to eat led to him losing tremendous amounts of weight and being hospitalized things looked very bleak  and they opted for a surgery to clear the blockage  as risky as it was  there was no other option  while paul came through the surgery and was able to start eating again  the hopedfor weight gain and return to a better level of strength did not materialize he was eating and not putting the weight back on  and he continued to lose strength the doctors told him there were no more medical options  however they were not willing to give up  they had heard about an alternative treatment center in germany that reported having success with his type of cancer they knew it was a long shot  but were going to give it everything they ve got  it was essentially the last ditch effort at treatment there is available  they fundraised in their local community and managed to raise the money to go  i was preparing to post a request for assistance online again  but they actually raised the money more quickly than expected paul left for the sixweek treatment program with high spirits  we even had a going away party for him with a big banner that read   never tell me the odds  which the whole town got together and signed it was a blast  sadly  it was a going away party in more ways than one only a week into his sixweek program the doctors learned that his kidneys and liver were shutting down he was immediately booked for a flight home because they believed he would soon not be well enough to travel they were right  only seven days after arriving home  paul slipped into a coma and passed away two days later  his funeral is this friday  so keep his family in your thoughts at that time if you can his  obituary     <URL>  desclast_name  asc  can be seen online  paul spoke so highly of the star wars community here at reddit  he and his wife read each and every message they received  and we know for a fact it was the high volume of emails lucasfilm got about paul that had them get into contact with him and his family hearing from jj was a big highlight for them he was offered an early screening but turned it down as he was feeling well enough to go to the theater and did nt want to miss the experience  but the fact that they offered was enough  i m trying to think of something to do to help his family now  to help with their expenses or his boys  education the guys who made the original video are interested in doing something else  perhaps  so i will keep you posted we may need some help to get support if we try and raise some funds for his family  thanks again may the force be with you 
1210,starwars,rip 
1211,starwars,damn rip
1212,starwars,i wonder if that was intentional on the part of the prop makers or if they just did it to make it look cool 
1213,starwars,these are awesome they both blend really well to the environment  especially the xwing   seeing these posts makes me want to try it but i suck at painting 
1214,starwars,hello everyone  with ep viii filming information hitting now  the mods have decided to put it to a vote on what we do with the policy     here are your options     keep everything as is until dvdbluray release  every spoiler about tfa is fair game except  the big one  which will still need to be marked in comments and wo nt be allowed in titles  everything spoiler about tfa is fair game   please vote here     strawpollme6<SMILE>24332   if you ve got another option you think is better than these three feel free to comment 
1215,starwars,i truly think it s about time all tfa info is open without spoiler tagging anymore it s been two whole months since it came out and even in china  one of the last countries to get it  it opened a month ago  what i think needs to be reinforced are the r1 and viii spoiler policies  especially in titles more and more information will begin to come out in the near future and even if it seems irrelevant to some  others might not want to know about it until they watch the movie  s   minor things i do nt really care but i know some folks do so better to be safe about it imo 
1216,starwars,its been out for 2 months  if someone has not seen it they are not a star wars fan make everything fair game 
1217,starwars,to anybody that still has nt seen the movie  what s preventing you from doing so  and why are you here 
1218,starwars,now what about the issue of banning for tagged spoilers in nonflaired threads  it s definitely too harsh  though i understand it s about mobile app users maybe instead of banning that person mods could simply flair the thread andor warn the user about the rule 
1219,starwars,i think its time to just let the policy go its your fault if you browse a star wars forum and you have nt seen it yet it took me 2 weeks to see the movie  but i did nt browse this sub because i knew it would have spoilers 
1220,starwars,seems most fair to everyone in this subreddit to unspoiler everything about tfa except that    s  han solo dies   since this  is  a star wars specific subreddit the only reason we should hide the mentioned spoiler is our content can spill into rall and it is a substantial event near the climax of the movie  i also like what was said in another post about malicious spoilers 
1221,starwars,awesome job  a lot of these  adding to thrift paintings  posts can be really garish or just plain rubbish  but i d say your additions fit in really well 
1222,starwars,i really wish they would give her a double bladed lightsaber they re just so awesome and it d be cool seeing a jedi use them  in the movies  
1223,starwars,weird  but true long red wire barely exposed blue wire cool    <URL>
1224,starwars,wait  laura dern is in episode viii 
1225,starwars,wow  you look just like her 
1226,starwars,pretty sure you  are  laura dern s daughter  any strange stories about your birth from your parents  do they quickly change the subject when you bring it up 
1227,starwars,she s  uh tenacious 
1228,starwars,op is on point 
1229,starwars,very impressive and very funny  
1230,starwars,you win the internet today 
1231,starwars,what happened to her neck in the second one 
1232,starwars,yes but purple
1233,starwars,every spoiler should be fair game 61 days since it came out  if someone has nt seen it and they re on the star wars reddit  that s just irresponsible 
1234,starwars,i m fine with keeping the policy as is it has not been a grave burden  i think 
1235,starwars,it s looking like everything is gon na be fair game may be too soon to say  but i would nt mind i think everyone will be happier all the way aroundless work for all those involved 
1236,starwars,yea you look enough like her to be relatedyou should send this to disney and see what happens 
1237,starwars,i love it how you switched which side you were on got me a couple of times there 
1238,starwars,so is david lynch gon na make movies anymore  you gon na be in his next one  just curious 
1239,starwars,everything spoiler about tfa should be fair game as others have said  if life circumstances have prevented you from seeing the film then you should nt be on rstarwars  and honestly i do nt know how you ve avoided spoilers until now  because it s not like everywhere has an overly polite spoiler policy like we have here  
1240,starwars,as i upvoted you  i now demand you take me to the prescreening of sw<SMILE>
1241,starwars,holy shit that is scary  attractive  and confusing 
1242,starwars,if only dooku did nt fall to the dark side i could have gone back to yoda   also  it just hit me the title of the post makes it sound like reys about to get herself a fancy beard lol hope you guys like it anyway  
1243,starwars,love it  
1244,starwars,kind of a random selection of images are we sticking with only  human  jedi  but leaving out anakin  we used older recluse luke  whom we know nothing about  instead of actual return of the jedi jedi luke  and it seems more like a crude mockup of jedi mount rushmore than a  poster  
1245,starwars,luke did nt die in vii though
1246,starwars,you re hot
1247,starwars,op  are you sure you are nt actually laura dern 
1248,starwars,you re hired
1249,starwars,plot twist  op is actually laura dern and is just trolling us trying to make us think she is a lookalike 
1250,starwars,impressive most impressive 
1251,starwars,wow  the last 2 actually made me do a double take you got those expressions down 
1252,starwars,hold the hell up  where the hell is ewan   
1253,starwars,no uncle luke 
1254,starwars,that blue wall scares the hell out of me 
1255,starwars,with blackjack n hookers 
1256,starwars,the clone wars cartoon confirmed jango died in an episode that featured a young boba posing as a clone 
1257,starwars,i like it disney knows we want a connection to the past i think they ll give us want we want that s what disney does 
1258,starwars,the thing that jango cares about most is boba it s a cool idea  but there is no way he is going to put his son in the hands of some clone  even though all three are genetically identical  
1259,starwars,and this is how ancient aliens came to be 
1260,starwars, i ve lived long enough to see the same fireplaces in different houses 
1261,starwars,rey vs kylo 2 ending with kylo cutting off rey s arm 
1262,starwars,coolbut why 
1263,starwars,i ca nt tell the difference  just a shadow falls over his face i think it would be better to hear ewan mcgregor s voice saying  i m obiwan kenobi   like he s remembering the past and we re getting a little bit of a spoiler for the next set of lines 
1264,starwars,i want rey to turn evil and <URL> the chief villain  people would lose their minds
1265,starwars,still my favorite saber in all of star wars it s just so pure  so simple  so complete when luke first ignited it  i was just blown away it fits him so well 
1266,starwars,i fucking hate how this person bastardized camp  h fucking disgrace
1267,starwars,i actually had this idea for a crappy edgy sith oc when i was in high school covered in scars  obsessed with tracking down and killing darth vaderi had him fail  of course would nt mind if they went this route  but i think some part of me will always wish they went with actual <SMILE>0 foot giant sith lord 
1268,starwars,good luck unseeing that for the rest of the time you live there
1269,starwars,awesome 
1270,starwars,japan s merchandise game this year was very strong star wars  mascara     <URL>    can cooler     <URL>  and  remote controlled fridge     <URL>   the price on the last one would be  <SMILE>600 usd for preorders only i also really liked these figure designs  crossing over the  star wars universe with traditional japanese armour     <URL>  
1271,starwars,where in japan  
1272,starwars, me too      <URL> 
1273,starwars,i like 
1274,starwars,hey a while ago  there was this screen cap from one of the new comics in which vader smashes two stormtroopers together to shield himself from blasters does anyone know which comic  and issue also  it s from 
1275,starwars,that had better be a brown lightsaber he s waving 
1276,starwars,my lord  he s a tripod 
1277,starwars,his friends call him yeremy 
1278,starwars,they would go well with the lightsaber chopsticks i bought over there 
1279,starwars,so which ones have you eaten off of so far  because you had no clean plates at the time and really did nt feel like washing any
1280,starwars,freakin awesome
1281,starwars,i love that extralong saber hilt it s cool  very guardianesque for her to basically have a  bastard sword  saber the whole ensemble is pretty badass  i always liked juhani as a character  but she was pretty weirdlooking in kotor they made the cathar look a lot better in swtor 
1282,starwars, that  was the best part of your trip to japan 
1283,starwars,yes luke escaped the destruction of the death star  why would nt the emperor and vader  and vader would have still been evil 
1284,starwars, judge me by my size  did you  
1285,starwars,i ended up making one instead of doing an actual assignment  woops  impressive detailing to it are you able to add color like in solid edge     <URL>
1286,starwars,more like did all that death star and rebel stuff matter when we have light sabers to look at  
1287,starwars,i feel excited for her now and i do nt even know her 
1288,starwars,where did finn get all this emotion it seems like soon as he leaves the firstorder he s a completely normal socially competent human being an from what i understand the firstorder raises their storm troopers to have no social skills and just follow orders kind of like the clones  so my question is where did you get all that emotion and social abilities  wouldnt he supposed to be just like a robot 
1289,starwars,one thing that stood out to me immediately about the ending was how damn long rey was stuck holding her arm out to luke like  after a while i was thinking  so is he gon na bring that to him with the force or what  
1290,starwars,a 2v2 lightsaber battle
1291,starwars,i d have liked at least a mention of the clone wars  the sith  the empire  the first order  what about the separatists  they were a pretty big threat
1292,starwars,my friend suggested to me that finn is the actual  awakening  of the force  which helps suspend my disbelief as to how socially competent he is and why he is the lone defective stormtrooper in a galaxy far  far away 
1293,starwars,more politics please the prequels spoiled us by showing us the inner workings and political dealings of the galaxy  which i found very interesting  in tfa  the political landscape is rather complex but we get nothing to explain any of it i would ve liked to see the new republic capital  the chancellor  the senate  and their relationship with the resistance  i know there were deleted scenes that delved into the politics of the movie  and i can only hope a fanedit appears later that adds these in 
1294,starwars,why does everyone on this subreddit know her 
1295,starwars,i have the dumbest complaint in the history of movies but i wish they had nt used the word boyfriend and they used it twice it just does nt feel like a word that people in the star wars universe should use 
1296,starwars,gt  what small changes would you make  i d remove starkiller base 
1297,starwars,i d make it so they d wait an episode to fire starkiller base 
1298,starwars,so i live in chicago i used to live in la and do improv comedy last october a friend of mine whom i used to be on an improv team with in la came to visit me we went to see some comedy on saturday and were slated to see another show on monday until she got a call and had to suddenly leave for an audition in london i m thinking  cool  good for her she is the sweetest person and while she gets a decent stream of acting gigs she s still supporting herself with a day job so the idea of a bigger opportunity sounds great she ca nt really talk much about it  fairly standard  so i do nt pry  cut to yesterday i get this text from her  gt  hey tuxedo  so this is the weirdest text ever  but i am involved in something weird that s hitting the news tomorrow  and then i m shutting off my phone and staying offline after it breaks just wanted to let you know that i m not ignoring you if you try and reach out  will be in touch soon    what     i m so confused and concerned for her my wife and i start wildly speculating could she be involved in some hollywood scandal  did something bad happen  what news could be this good i m basically just hoping that it s nothing too bad we talk about it for like 10 minutes then set a google alert for her name and forget about it  then we wake up to this quote from this morning s announcement  gt  new cast members will include academy award winner benicio del toro  academy award nominee laura dern  and talented <URL> kelly marie tran  turns out my friend kelly who i used to make shit up with for tiny audiences in la is going to be in star wars ep viii    i m freaking out and so happy for her and just had to share with the one sub who i know would share in my enthusiasm and appreciate the story  tl  dr my friend is <URL> kelly marie tran and i m so freakin  excited i just had to sharebrag 
1299,starwars,extremely powerful go read dark disciple  one of the new canon books   it showcases his abilities against an assortment of situations 
1300,starwars,luke skywalker was located  when he s interrogating rey  he starts  seeing  what she sees in her mind  during this scene he says something along the lines of the following  i see the sea i see an island  now  i ca nt find the script to see if it backs me up on this  as i might have heard it wrong  but if i did  i think that was a very nicely placed bit of dialogue 
1301,starwars,very he was one of the best lightsaber duelists in the jedi order  second only to yoda and possibly mace windu 
1302,starwars,it may have been from legends  but i remember reading that he was as powerful if not more powerful than mace who was second only to yoda  so pretty darn powerful 
1303,starwars,watching him in the clone wars  he easily takes on many jedi at a time so how powerful was he really  
1304,starwars,powerful enough that he comes off as a credible threat in clone wars despite the plot necessity that  as a recurring villain  he fail repeatedly  and being more powerful than your plotnecessitated failures is something indeed   this as opposed to  say  grievous  who comes off as pretty danged <URL> over the course of the show 
1305,starwars,should be mounted on the bathroom door looking in 
1306,starwars, huge crash  we know you found it 
1307,starwars,i guess i do nt understand these kind of decorations  why would kylo ren  or any of the other variants of this decoration  peekaboo slam their face through a wall 
1308,starwars,cool fan art  but looking at it from a more critical view  would nt the cockpithead be a massive weak point because it is lacking armor 
1309,starwars,that lightsaber it belongs to him 
1310,starwars,the resistance must master the little known force cough to knock it over 
1311,starwars,taking inspiration from salvador dali  perhaps 
1312,starwars,looks terrible 
1313,starwars,take out a leg and tiiimmmbberrrrrrr
1314,starwars,this is a female atat judging by its genitalia 
1315,starwars,i do nt know why im annoyed at the lightsaber being starkillers and not anakinlukes  pretty good though 
1316,starwars,how did you even do this 
1317,starwars,that s awesome  i ve had kev smith and buzz aldrin like a tweetit s always a kick but it s not a patch on having luke skywalker liking something that has anything to do with you 
1318,starwars,and it looks like you could win an xbox for free  too 
1319,starwars, this canon novel     <URL>  _beware_the_power_of_the_dark_side   sort of implies this  by the narrator advising it s best not to ask about where the meat came from 
1320,starwars,that s just really cool well done 
1321,starwars,nicely done  do you plan on doing the other films as well 
1322,starwars,the real question is  did luke and the gang eat them as well  you know so as not to offend the ewoks 
1323,starwars,my favorite post title in a while 
1324,starwars,i do nt know about this  when the ewoks were going to eat the heroes  they were going to  roast them alive   maybe they would nt care for alreadydead imperials 
1325,starwars,i wish we could filter out boba fett posts 
1326,starwars,han  leia  and chewie most likely had some stormtrooper meat as well during the ewok celebration they would not have wanted to offend their hosts by refusing to join in 
1327,starwars,or ewoks are like 99  of all carnivores on earth  especially the more braindeveloped ones  and do nt eat anything they do nt kill themselves given that they attempted to cook luke and han before killing them  i doubt they d collect and cook alreadydead stormtroopers
1328,starwars,laura dern is in her 40s i think so you could be her daughter
1329,starwars,so that would make you rey s auntleia 
1330,starwars,you have a terry garr look also 
1331,starwars,lol the picture of laura dern in jpark is her stunt double 
1332,starwars,magical work
1333,starwars,you are adorable and the resemblance is uncanny 
1334,starwars,love this  great style little ben is adorable 
1335,starwars,he says  you imagine an ocean  i see it i see the island  he s interpreting her dreams most likely rey s vision of the future through the force 
1336,starwars,that ewok was playing the drums on the helmets fyi  yeah they ate them but he was nt  seasoning  anything get your facts straight man 
1337,starwars,probably right  and i bet they did it in threepio s honor i wonder if luke  han  or leia had any 
1338,starwars,considering the ewoks were going to eat luke  han and chewbacca  it only makes sense that if the dead stormtroopers were still fresh  then they ate them i m guessing that s what they were having at the celebration for example   <URL> my guess is they re slow roasting their brains  helmet on take another look  here we actually see an ewok seasoning them   <URL> this guy definitely ate some   <URL> 
1339,starwars,devour your soul  i will
1340,starwars,that vader and poe cover look pretty awesome 
1341,starwars,that was a great interview  well written and very interesting 
1342,starwars,i m new to the whole comic thing  is there a new issue every month  i binged the darth vader and kanaan ones on the marvel app  just wondering when they come out 
1343,starwars,just wait till it gets windy 
1344,starwars,i agree that it would look visually striking  but i dont think it would fit luke swinging two sabers would give it a sort of prequelish feel that i would nt like it would look cool  but the tone would be wrong and it would feel out of character to me 
1345,starwars,i love this idea   though my image of luke at the moment is more akin to obiwan in 4 and yoda in 5more of a teacher than a fighter i ca nt  and i do nt know if i would want to  see him doing any fancy fighting but if he held them both at some point  that would be cool 
1346,starwars,is it an unpopular opinion to say that i d rather see less of him fighting with his saber at all  i always thought that  when kenobi was forced to battle vader again in anh  we were supposed to feel kind of sorry for him as we saw when he became one with the force midfight  a battle to the plasmacharred death was beneath the dignity of a man long past the prime of his body and spirit  sure  luke training rey would be a different situation  but i think i d really rather not see him go to lightsaberskilldisplay territory i see their sparring as slowpaced  a mind game  far more about learning about the force than about exhibiting prowess 
1347,starwars,are nt all the knights of ren gone  though  snoke calls kylo   the last of the knights of ren 
1348,starwars,no 
1349,starwars,i was expecting grass  sticks  maybe a storm trooper or two that xwing is badass nice job 
1350,starwars,training is voluntary i assume she got  some  training  but she was raised to be a politician and leader  not a jedi her interests and inclinations do nt lend themselves to luke s path  but being the general is in line with those interests and inclinations 
1351,starwars,better question  why was luke the  chosen one  that obi and yoda were prepping to drop on the emperor when leia was fighting the rebel war since her teen years  new the enemy well and seemed to be a capable tactition  when luke was just farming water in the desert 
1352,starwars,because she took too many drugs during the <SMILE>0 s 
1353,starwars,i ca nt decide whether or not i like that this duel is consistent with the prequel films  dueling style of excess twirling and hanging back when your partner is engaged rather than joining in i mean  it s consistent  but personally i also find it a little silly  on the other hand  a small detail that i really do love is that anakin and obi wan s lightsabers are slightly different shades of blue 
1354,starwars,so technically this is the last fight between anakin and dooku before anakin killed him if that is cannon then the line  my powers have doubled since i last faced you  really does nt make sense anymore 
1355,starwars,instead of waiting around for episode <SMILE> to come out  i came up with my own ideas  the movie begins with supreme leader snoke viciously training kylo ren kylo takes on 15 stormtroopers and wins we are introduced to the knights of ren that  like vader in episode 3  crave the powers of immortality and ressurection there is syma ren  the last clone produced for the clone wars he never got to fight due to the war s end  and he was left with a short lifespan due to his being a clone the kaminoans tried to increase his life span  but eventually syma ren just slaughtered them all and created a suit that keeps him alive before <URL> a knight of ren the other knights are nala ren  a former bounty hunter with a scoundrel personality and nothing better to do  nexo ren  a mad scientist with an unpredictable personality  and rexus ren  a mandalorian who craves war so much  he wants to fight forever and  in case he kills everybody  ressurect his enemies they are preparing to attack luke since rey used the millenium falcon  which is easily trackable  the reason the force awakens gave for han solo and the gangs tracking down the millenium falcon and also why they went to takodana in the first place in order to get a new ship   we cut back to rey and luke after a few seconds of the same intense stare from the end of the force awakens  luke slowly approaches rey then starts crying and gives her a hug  luke is rey s dad  the scene plays out but when it ends  kylo ren s ship jumps out of hyperspace and lands on luke s planet along with an armada of star destroyers to engage the resistance in space in order to stop them from helping luke  luke does nt need a lightsaber he crushes kylo ren s ship with the force and throws it in the ocean there is no escape now while luke holds off the knights of ren using nothing but the force  rey has a rematch with kylo ren only this time  kylo is winning  we cut to another problem after the destruction of the new republic s hosnian system  the entire galaxy has been thrown into chaos so many factions are trying to take control of the galaxy  the black sun  the imperial loyalists  the mandalorians  and of course  the first order and the resistance poe dameron is sent to settle a dispute  and not a trade one  between the black sun and the new mandalorians it gets tense and eventually fighting starts  back to luke and rey kylo defeats rey luke reluctantly retreats to the millenium falcon with an unconcious rey luke contacts leia and orders the resistance to retreat  poe dameron returns to the resistance  unable to prevent another bloody battle  for the first time in a decade  luke and leia reunite it is very tense luke tells leia that there was a reason he was on that planet  to protect its secrets the temple doubles as the first jedi temple and the first sith temple since back then the difference between dark side and light side had not been established and everything was mostly experimentation  but most importantly  the temple contains what the knights of ren want  the secrets of immortality and ressurection  on luke s planet  the knights of ren are steaming they think they failed  but nexo ren does not unlike the others  he realizes they are standing near a sith temple eventually  they enter the temple and guess what they find  their dreams <URL>  we cut to kylo s star destroyer it is revealed that han solo s body was recovered from starkiller base thanks to some familiar nifty chutes will we see han solo get ressurected  cut back to rey she wakes up luke is waiting for her rey tearfully asks her father why she was abandoned on jakku confused  luke responds that he did not put her on jakku and tells her that he senses that somebody used the force to tamper with her mind luke attempts to restore her memory rey remembers her training as a padawan in the jedi academy  all her friends and how they were slaughtered by the knights of ren luke stops halfway  keep this in mind   realizing that the experience is too intense for rey or anybody for that matter rey can barely contain her rage kylo ren is responsible for all her problems  cut back to the knights of ren they are preparing to ressurect han solo the process is strange and esoteric eventually han solo starts breathing everyone is shocked ben solo approaches his father  i had a dream   han says  in it  you killed me  silence  it was only a dream   kylo says  pretending to chuckle but holding back tears  where am i   han mutters han sees the knights of ren and his health  which is being monitored  starts dropping drastically  it was nt a dream   han mutters he keeps repeating it over and over and over ben is horrified flatline like padme  han solo lost the will to live  i ll add more later  to be continued
1356,starwars,i hope you enjoyed reading what i have so far   which is in the op  here is the continuation  to understand kylo ren as a person  we must go back to the past  as mentioned briefly in the force awakens  han was not the best father and leia was always busy with politics and whatnot nobody had time for ben  one day  while being bullied for the fiftieth time  using the force for the first time  ben pushed a bully into a wall terrified of his new power  he ran away and found a place to cry alone or so he thought snoke appeared his appearance was less corrupted by the dark side snoke  comforted   really more like brainwashed  ben by telling him that what he did was justified because the bully did the same to him snoke then proceeds to tell ben the story of darth vader and the knights of ren darth vader helped create peace and order for the first time ever only for it to be destroyed by the rebel alliance and their chaotic new republic the knights of ren were obssesed with achieving the power of ressurection eventually  they gained it  and using it  they literally ressurected the sith and created the last sith empire  for peace and order of course  wink   before the republic came along and the sith had to follow the rule of two  but they were betrayed by the very sith they ressurected  eventually  ben came back home leia thought it would be a good idea to take advantage of ben s force sensitivity and send him off to luke but to ben it was like being abandoned  snoke continued brainwashing ben slowly  methodically  but there was always one thing standing in the way  his cousin  rey rey was the only person who was ever nice to him he related to rey because often rey was alone and ignored because her parents were always so busy when the time came to kill all the students of the jedi academy  kylo ren could not kill rey  we even see him  in rey s force vision  stabbing a knight of ren that was about to attack rey   being an unstable impulsive teen  he altered her memory and left her on jakku rey is kylo s mistake and also the key to his redemption 
1357,starwars,i ca nt seem to find out his identity does anyone know who this is and what species he is  i took two screenshots  he is on the far left in both     <URL>
1358,starwars, rogwa wodrata     <URL>   who is infact female
1359,starwars,apparently that is  rogwa     <URL>  
1360,starwars,this one was good  but there are far better duels within tcw 
1361,starwars, yep  it s a misprint     <URL> 
1362,starwars,its worth a million dollars       
1363,starwars,are misprints worth more or something
1364,starwars,hey  this was really good 
1365,starwars,not contestwinning material  but the thought counts did it taste good 
1366,starwars,totally getting a classic lucasarts game vibe from this 
1367,starwars,kamino  i love everything about that place 
1368,starwars,mine is probably naboo  because it s so freaking beautiful   edit    or alderaan  which was also gorgeous  for the  wow that s pretty awesome  factor  i pick coruscant 
1369,starwars,damn  i never noticed the venator in the backround  btw  my favourite planet is coruscant
1370,starwars,hoth looks pretty  cool 
1371,starwars,i m with you op    kashyyyk   was gorgeous and it s the  home of the wookiees  and we got  like  a couple of minutes of screen time there really would have loved more of yoda and the wookiees battle there 
1372,starwars,not a planet  but a moon  nar shadaa i ve read and reread the han solo origin trilogy a ton  and always love how its depicted like a multi level las vegas where business opportunities and pleasure seeking are around every corner 
1373,starwars,also it is just too big for my iphone wallpaper   such a great picture though thanks op 
1374,starwars,tweet liked by mark hamill and gorgeous  swoon 
1375,starwars,you are a god 
1376,starwars,and its legends does that mean lucas took mundi from legends and put him in the prequels 
1377,starwars,this is probably not the most popular but i like lothal 
1378,starwars,kessel i just ca nt quit that spice
1379,starwars,i ve grown to like the yellow plains of lothal  the emptiness outside the cities seem so melancholy and beautiful 
1380,starwars,it s a moon rather than a planet but i love nar shaddaa  moon of nal hutta  home world of the hutts it s like if all of coruscant dropped the pretense and embraced the seedy underworld
1381,starwars,kind of boring answer with how many times it s popping up in the thread  but i ll be honest and say coruscant  it s one of the coolest scifi settings ever and i hope we get to see it again in the future 
1382,starwars,mine is coruscant it s the home to a jedi templecool underworld levelsentire planet is a big city
1383,starwars,before revealing himself as lord of the sith  senator palpatine did a sick yyz bass cover his slogan was  i ai nt need no g string  i got enough on my bedroom floor from my palpahoes  edit  seriously  where is your g string
1384,starwars,  <URL>
1385,starwars,   spoilers included for episode vii ending    hi everyone  new to the subreddit but longtime star wars fan apologies if this has been posted before but   i have some star wars truthering to do    one that challenges the narrative of the ending with which we ve been presented by lucasfilm  jj  rian and co   i would like to pause here to note that this is not a theory borne out of malice or wanting to expose something horrible  i love episode vii  sure i ll viii i just thought of it today and think it merits exploring and that it potentially reveals some insight into the creative process we ll see     anyway  my theory  the ending of episode vii where  spoiler again  rey extends the lightsaber to luke was never intended to be the ending of episode vii   stick with me here  so today  we were shown footage from the first day of production on episode viii which we were also told was happening at pinewood studios in london however  the footage we were shown was from rian s shoot at skellig michael i assume its footage from when he was spotted there with daisy ridley and mark hamill in fall 2015    <URL> the first thing that struck me about the footage is that it used alternate shots of the same scene we saw at the end of episode vii also  pinewood studios is in london  not ireland so yeah nothing nefarious  right  except  why was rian ever shooting alternate takes of a scene we already see at the end of episode vii  where would that possibly be included in vii  featuring something like that is unprecedented in star wars  and sure  episode vii did some unprecedented things  but no  even small  time jump would just be odd  this lead me to a realization  the ending of episode vii was shot by rian and the original ending of vii was intended to be some form of rey with chewie flying off to find luke when jj and disney execs looked at the cut  they realized they did in fact maybe want luke in this film and got rian to handle the scene while jj finished up post and promotion to avoid any talks of reshoots remember that people panicked at the smallest delays in this process  another reason i think this  rey flying off at light speed  is  a star wars ending i love the ending with luke  but we ve never seen anything like it before also consider that rey and crew arrive at luke s planet literally right after a quick light speed jump why  probably because we were never supposed to get there in this film it plays like a second ending because it is one   this ending also could ve been added because it fit better with rian johnson s script  this also fits with michael ardnt s own assessment of problems with his script  he could nt figure out luke my theory is that kasdan and jj took over and pushed luke completely out of it  whereas arndt had him arriving more at the midpoint  and then realized they <URL> and people might hate not seeing luke at all in this film  to recap   episode vii ending was supposed to be rey flying off into the sunset on a search for luke   jj and co got rian to shoot the skellig michael ending  passing it off as them starting on episode viii months before they actually would  with an announced delay in between   this might have a lot of errors and someone might be able to easily disprove this and i <URL> it  i would love to hear people s general reaction to this might edit for links and errors thanks  reddit  edit  user umutantchair has provided us with this behind the scenesvisit ireland video showing jj on skellig    <URL>  v  hjngrtatrdg i m not ready to take this to the truther levels of jj was only there to cover everything else upbut wo nt stop anyone else obviously  the most interesting thing remains that we may now be about to see the first star wars film to pick up directly where the previous left off so looking forward to discussions around that 
1386,starwars,there is only 1 problem with your theory  which i think could be right  btw   the shots shown in this teaser were shot in full daylight  both for luke s cu and for rey s ots harsh  undiffused daylight all the shots from the ending of tfa were shot on an overcast day while it is possible that may have shot 2 different versions of the scene  one with an overcast day and another one in a sunny day  it is unlikely they would have done this  unless they shot all the shots in the scene both ways   also  is nt there a behind the scenes video showing jj at this location with ridley and the crew 
1387,starwars,interesting  and possible  i figured the point was to tie up the episode vii arc of her getting roped in  her wanting to run  then her performing the greatest act she could as a part of her new destiny plus what an ending look at that badass i could have cried the first viewing han solo   chewie we re home  1010 moment luke skywalker     1510 i lost my crap strictly curious why does it matter that she went to lightspeed and then arrived  she just got the coordinates  could have just shown here pulling up with chewie i would nt be surprised if you re right edit   pulling up with chewie  is probably not the best way to say  arriving on the secluded island of luke skywalker 
1388,starwars,i feel like the fact hamill was in the first cast photo disproves this he would have had to have been in a draft at that point 
1389,starwars,this may not be the place for it buy i have a theory about the filming process i think that the role maz played was originally supposed to be leia i think her character could have fit into that role of the associatelink to the resistance very well and fit hans slight reluctance when he mentions he knows someone that could get them in touch with the resistance it also makes more sense to me for leia to be the one to give rey the lightsaber and tell her about the force also it makes the scene towards the end when she hugs rey make more sense because as it stands it s weird that she and chewy do nt say a word after han s death and instead she goes and hugs rey  i think that after the started running lines with the actors they realized that carrie s acting had gotten pretty stiff and did an easy edit to limit her lines while still making her important enough to sell the whole passing of the torch motif 
1390,starwars,to be perfectly honest  i do think tfa would have been better served without the luke ending  and held over until ep viii i think your theory has definite merit 
1391,starwars,quick question was bounty hunting legal in the new republic 
1392,starwars,kylo does nt even realize just how out of his league darth vader is  and i do nt mean just in terms of vader s power with the force or the empire  s galactic conquests kylo is straightup missing the boat on the source of vader s darkness kylo believes that vader had some sort of ambition to bring order to the galaxy  and kylo also appears to presume that it was this ambition that served as the source of vader s dark power perhaps  ambition eventually fuels the fire for vader  but with the exception of a couple lines of dialog on naboo  there s just no indication that this was ever anakin s core motivation and that  s the key  the source of vader  s darkness has little to do about vader and much to do about anakin no  it wasn  t pure ambition for power  instead  it was anakin s love towards his mother and wife  the only people ever to show anakin unconditional love and warmth  which eventually leads to darkness  it s understandable for anakin  he grew up a slave to a single mother  and he had it rough this was not the princely upbringing likely enjoyed by ben solo so when anakin goes on some terrifying adventure  leaving his slave mother behind  never to see her again until she dies in his arms after being tortured to deathwhich he was forced to witness through nightmares  that is some heavy shit  anakin feels an immediate burden of loss and guilt that kylo simply could not begin to understand  so what does anakin do next  he vows never to let this happen to anyone he loves ever again  now that is ambition  but wait  there  s more   because it does happen again  but this time to the woman of his dreams for 10 years this dude waited to be with padme  he  s got all these new powers and abilities  and then he  s forced to face a repeat of his haunted past  nightmares of the death of the most important person in his life  and yet again  there s nothing he can do about it take all that lingering guilt and remorse over the loss of his mother  multiply it  and finally sprinkle on top the fact that this time it was actually anakin  s fault yikes  back to kylo sure  his dad might not always be around  his mom can be  tough  to deal with from time to time  and he  s stuck with his weird uncle maybe the politics of the new republic are pretty infuriating and the need for a strong leader is obvious perhaps an early 2000  s pop punk mix cd really hit a nerve in all seriousness  we re not 100  sure yet what the true cause of kylo s fall to the darkside was either way  it  s just not the same and it never could be can you blame kylo for not being  dark  enough  i don  t  he doesn  t have the rush of profound pain that fuels anakin  s dark side  for me  rewatching the prequels after tfa and comparing the characters of kylo and anakin helped me to appreciate both characters in new ways for kylo  i love the tragic struggle to find darkness where there is no pain  or at least not at the same level as anakin   for anakin  i have a new recognition for the overwhelming helplessness and loss resulting from his futile struggle to hold on to the ones he loves the complimentary nature of the two paths to darkness is satisfying in a way that feels very  star wars   and most of all i find myself enjoying both the pt and tfa more as a result 
1393,starwars,spot on ben solo has some first world problems  and goes apeshit emo hot topic
1394,starwars,i enjoyed reading this nice point of view 
1395,starwars,this is bad ass art but none of it is screaming star wars other than the lightsaber and the not so redesigned emperor 
1396,starwars, source     <URL> 
1397,starwars, this film needs to exist 
1398,starwars,imhotep imhotep 
1399,starwars,is there a gallery of the best ones anywhere 
1400,starwars,i ve seen it 6 times and i could nt place what was bothering me so much about the xwing attack on starkiller until my most recent viewing aside from what i think are some weird cockpit interior camera angles  the flight control sticks are too big  in the battle of yavin the view of the pilot s face really immersed you but in tfa it looks like the joysticks are level with the pilots  chests it s not a big deal it just makes it look really fake to me
1401,starwars,i m am so pumped for episode viii right now the fact that it is being directed by rian johnson makes me even more excited 
1402,starwars,its barely been two months disney why do you do this to me
1403,starwars,yes  that is a photo of her drawing on my fridge  naturally 
1404,starwars,i m digging the electronicambient interpretation of the rebel fanfare 
1405,starwars,i m touching myself tonight 
1406,starwars,enjoy the lifetime of fandom with your daughter  are you going to take her to see tfa in theaters or wait for the dvdblurey to come out 
1407,starwars,you re doing a great job
1408,starwars,for whatever reason i read that as  found this in my girlfriends backpack   i got really confused
1409,starwars,i think you re right  i agree  as awesome as it was seeing luke  even for that brief and silent minute  it felt a bit tacked on serieswise  it makes more sense to end tfa with rey going off on her search for luke and then actually finding him early in viii 
1410,starwars,awww  amazing   my son and i have been staying up late at night and making our way through in 30 minute intervals just finished empire last night 
1411,starwars,you are doing fatherhood right 
1412,starwars,that s adorable 
1413,starwars,looks cool  would have been kinda cool if the death star was a pyramid as well 
1414,starwars,and it s highlighted with yellow marker  so you know it s really real 
1415,starwars,hi  i had a really interesting idea for a star wars story set in the late clone wars  an idea that i ve had since about season 2 or 3 of the show was on  and has developed to <URL> very detailed and presumably publishable should i actually pursue it i ve always thought about how easily the bounty hunter jango fett was killed on geonosis  i hope this does nt count as a spoiler to any new fans   he asked for an unaltered clone to be regarded as a son along with his pay  but nothing else in his quote  regarding who hired him  it s quite clear that he may have an idea that he is working with the sith  and they re not necessarily your most trustworthy bunch as a bounty hunter  he s probably been double crossed before  and when the sith double cross you  you end up dead  they do nt want loose ends to meddle in their plans   fett obviously ends up dead  or does he  which is where my story would come into play my proposal is that he secretly had a small group of clones conditioned to be loyal only to him  and that he deployed them as decoys when he felt he would be double crossed having been in close quarters with count dooku on geonosis  there is a very high likelihood that fett overheard some of the master plans of tyranus and sidious  and  feeling that he knows too much  the sith decide to arrange his death so  when mace windu beheads fett  or who everyone thinks is fett  in the arena  he applauds his performance  as he will not have to deal with the wily bounty hunter on his own terms after the battle my story will claim that fett felt that the arena battle  which would surely start the war the sith had been planning  would serve as a perfect place for his employers to arrange an accident for him  and thus save some more money  and hassle if the jedi were to get a hold on him   so  fett deploys a decoy that convinces even his  son  boba  allowing him free roam in the galaxy but this is just backstory in the actual events of the story  anakin skywalker and the 501st are pinned down on a system relatively not far from kamino  and all active units are heavily engaged in combat  allowing them no reinforcements as a last resort  they contact kamino to send fresh troops  despite the fact that the  shinies  would be slaughtered by the separatist resistance  to no avail  as tipoca city is on lockdown when lama su refuses to give details to the cause  skywalker  kenobi  and captain rex depart the battle  leaving the capable jedi master eeth koth to watch over the remaining forces until their return on their arrival  they discover fett s dna has been stolen  but only clones and kaminoans have had access to it for the time leading to its disappearance long story short  it was fett who had arranged the theft  using one of his decoys  to get the jedi s attention  because he slipped up on security and the sith discovered his survival fearing the worst  fett wants the jedi s protection in return for information on the plot to destroy them  but is captured in a separatist raid  and taken to be executed by the sith one daring rescue mission with heavy casualties later  fett is back under republic protection  and reveals what he knows about protocol 66 and the empire  but the torture inflicted on him has addled his mind  rendering him unable to create clear thoughts  and only gives fragmented information to the jedi  leaving them only with more questions than answers as he utters an ominous warning to the jedi  something along the lines of  the jedi are already extinct   an assassin shoots him through the heart  tying up the loose end i feel like this story fits well with the theme of the sixth season of the clone wars series  and may include some discussion between palpatine and dooku after fett s death  talking about the potential damage to their plans i just wanted to hear some feedback regarding whether or not i should go through with it  and best method of doing so 
1416,starwars,the blind lady gives me a strong kreia from kotor2 vibe
1417,starwars,this is amazing  if you are the one who made this  keep it up 
1418,starwars, the clone army and clone wars were nothing more than test beds for sidious  designs for the imperial army 
1419,starwars,the laat s are definitely the coolest vehicles in star wars
1420,starwars,ogt  
1421,starwars,best cartoon movie ever 
1422,starwars,also palpatines furniture in his apartment have deathstar designs 
1423,starwars,the zaps were so satisfying to watch 
1424,starwars,well i ll be 
1425,starwars,if only the prequels were crafted as well as the weaponry
1426,starwars,rcrappydesign
1427,starwars,it s like poetry like what i mean  like  it s as if  they actually  intended  this  man woah dude like  this is a next level conspiracy man 
1428,starwars,not all though the laat was a very versatile weapons platform  kind of like the today s t72 chassis which is also the chassis of many recovery vehicles  spgs  mlrs   ifvs and such there were cas versions of the laat and even aircranes for transport of tanks or clearing of debris it was a very effective vehicle when assaulting planets  you could bring in a regiment of clones with armour and cas support with these to set up a large perimeter for the transport ships to land and drop off the rest of the legion for further operations 
1429,starwars,i think that is just inspired from a b29 bombers ballturret or something  edit  i was wrong it was as uroflbbq pointed out b17 and b24 
1430,starwars,it just occurred to me that i have nt watched the prequels in  days 
1431,starwars,mind  blown
1432,starwars,the thermal exhaust port is his butt  
1433,starwars,does it bother anyone else how he shoots a big area of nothing but dirt  stops firing right as he gets to a huge group of droids and then fires again immediately after passing them 
1434,starwars,those cannons are awesome they are like large light sabers  jsut cut through anything 
1435,starwars,not sure if the deadpool ad is official  just a fun image i found 
1436,starwars,it s weird how everyone has their right eye covered
1437,starwars,so le quirky and random xd
1438,starwars,wow mindfucked  o
1439,starwars,there s also the core to the trade federation droid control ship 
1440,starwars,rchimichanga
1441,starwars,boss logic
1442,starwars,i ca nt look at the han solo poster that nose

1444,starwars,when are we gon na get upvote text with new quotes   droid please    that s not how the force works    stop taking my hand    you got a boyfriend  cute boyfriend    you probably did nt recognize me because of the red arm  etc etc  there are so many good ones 
1445,starwars,i literally went to deadpool because of the amazing billboards here in nz 
1446,starwars,the strict spoiler format should now be switched off for tfa and placed on all things viii 
1447,starwars,this was such a great story arc  if i recall correctly  that was sifodyas right  obiwan and anakin were  so close  to finding the truth of the clone wars there 
1448,starwars,deadpool is like an inside joke  funny to those who know him  but childishly annoying for those who do nt 
1449,starwars,my left or yours 
1450,starwars,han mofo
1451,starwars,chopper is to bb<SMILE> what vince russo is to wrestling  edit  i m saying he s a bad influence  not a heartless monster who will ruin bb<SMILE> and everything he stands for i love chopper 
1452,starwars,chopper is a cold blooded killer lol love that little droid
1453,starwars,i ca nt tell which one is or is nt laura dern 
1454,starwars,canon 
1455,starwars,felucia is pretty cool  with all that massive wildlife and jungle vibe
1456,starwars,nice try  laura dern 
1457,starwars,kamino because rain amp  cool architecture probably after that i d say mustafar 
1458,starwars,either umbara for it s bio luminescent flora and fauna  or manaan for everything from it s architecture to it s culture 
1459,starwars,wait are you actually just laura dern and you re fucking with us  i m a littlespicious  lady 
1460,starwars,she makes heaps of awesome props  helmets etc plus she s in the 501st so the quality is top notch    <URL>
1461,starwars,impressive  most  impressive 
1462,starwars,those are my son s two favorite droids 
1463,starwars,run  bb<SMILE>  chopper is a jealous asshole and is right behind you 
1464,starwars,wait was that actually new footage  holy crap 
1465,starwars,umbara  that shit was fucked up but the planet  looks  cool 
1466,starwars,the resistance is really bad at preventing its member from being captured and the first order is equally as bad at keeping them  oh  and ackbar s sweet ride make a return nice 
1467,starwars,does this make you a dernist 
1468,starwars,i can actually hear the chirpy yet angry droidswearing as chop sails through the air 
1469,starwars,my film study class had a discussion today about whether or not it s right for a director or movie maker to go back and make changes to the original movies inevitably  george lucas and star wars came upi wo nt launch a recycled  who shot first  debate  but rather  one about a change that is nt discussed as much  the voice  s  of boba fett  as you all probably know  jason wingreen voiced boba in the theatrical version of esb  and gave him a grittier  more rogue voice in the special edition changes  temura morrison rerecorded the lines following the revelation that boba was a clone of jango consequently  morrison essentially gave boba the voice of a clone trooper  which voice do you prefer for boba fett  and why 
1470,starwars,not sure if luke or jesus  he looks very cool 
1471,starwars,why is this failed actress playing in episode viii  because she s friend with kathleen kennedy  that s not how you make good movies 
1472,starwars,i love chopper lol but he s an asshole 
1473,starwars,he looks like fletch when he played for the lakers 
1474,starwars, captain phasma you have failed me for the first time 
1475,starwars,if i knew anything about editing  i would edit an actual gheri curl onto his head 
1476,starwars,that s all my mom has breast cancer  my dad is being tested for lung cancer  my cat is dying  my brother is failing his freshman year of high school and idk how to help him  i m struggling with mental illness but whenever i watch the force awakens trailer  or hear the score  or read fan theories on this subreddit  or look at fan art  i feel instantly happier 
1477,starwars,oh friend  i m sorry but i get you i m going through eerily similar troubles myself and i totally understand the sw universe actually helps me not to lose my mind and keep the spirits up  we re gon na make it this time will pass 
1478,starwars,things get better buddy keep looking forward the force will be with you  always 
1479,starwars,it s an island away from reality i try to visit it as often as i can 
1480,starwars,i m sorry all of this is happening to you goodluck and may the force be with you 
1481,starwars,my situation without getting specific is that i manage to fuck up everything i ve pretty much given up on succeeding at anything it s not as bad as your situation obviously but i still prefer escaping into the star wars universe  maybe i ll be like zayne carrick and be framed for murder after which i ll magically <URL> a badass lol mtfbwy
1482,starwars,how i felt after reading your story    <URL>
1483,starwars,i did nt see the progression in the first order stormy helmet until i saw this all is clear 
1484,starwars,here s a nice  high res video version      <URL> 
1485,starwars,i love this so much  although the nitpicking side of me has to point out that the republic s symbol had <SMILE> spokes still  the main show of the helmets is amazing 
1486,starwars,very nice animation  can i ask if you thought about adding jango fetts first since  i think  it s based off his outfit in the lore 
1487,starwars,my phone background is now cooler than anyone else s thanks
1488,starwars,really cool op  well done  love the splash of blood at the end 
1489,starwars,lt  golf clapgt 
1490,starwars,that s so smooth it it made santana jealous   could have been a touch slower though still awesome  
1491,starwars,the first ones are the best
1492,starwars,first two are nt stormtroopers  they re clone troopers 
1493,starwars,how s you get then talking at the end 
1494,starwars,there s some cool stuff here  man a lot of your visual and audio cues do nt quite match up  but when they do  i d say you nail it the intro was nice  using the bleak landscape of tatooine to go with the sparser music after that it gets a bit messy at times  but if this is your first time  keep going at it if you love it you ll only get better and better 
1495,starwars,  <URL>
1496,starwars,there are no breaks on this  hype  rspace train
1497,starwars, we can not repel treble power of this magnitude  
1498,starwars,and people say the ewoks were too cute and cuddly yea right  they were religious zealots who used the helmets of their fallen foes for drum solos 
1499,starwars,why would you flair this as fun  you sadistic animal 
1500,starwars, more evidence      <URL>  rebels at the feast with the ewoks  too busy celebrating to be paying attention to what they are eating 
1501,starwars,oh  the ewoks definitely ate the bodies of the dead troopers  and those were nt clones  they were volunteers 
1502,starwars,would be cool if the face morph would be a transition to one of obiwans memories from the past 
1503,starwars,he s gon na have some  real talk   with some  real folks  
1504,starwars,looks like he found kylo ren s lightsaber 
1505,starwars,dude  matt straight up sucks 
1506,starwars,i might be turning to the dark side  because i want to steal that 
1507,starwars,ahh yes  the matt amiibo finally instock 
1508,starwars,as a former naval aviation radar technicianhe should have his fingers crossed behind his back  too 
1509,starwars,i ca nt believe how spot on they got that sketch snl has been stepping up their game lately  looks awesome by the way 
1510,starwars,wow  you guys really liked that snl sketch 
1511,starwars,wow  is this from the new star wars miniatures set  s
1512,starwars,the only di 30 fig you will ever need 
1513,starwars,he looks like he belongs in the rudolf the red nosed reindeer special 
1514,starwars,if i toss this in my bath tub will it weigh 30 pounds 
1515,starwars,how much
1516,starwars, ca nt help but see this     <URL> 
1517,starwars,i m done with this it was a moderately amusing skit  we can just move on now there s tattoos out there for fuck s sake 
1518,starwars,i prefer morrison after all  boba is a fully unaltered clone  and to preserve continuity it only makes sense that boba should sound like his father i mean  i hold nothing against wingreen  he sounded awesome  but i think morrison makes more sense 
1519,starwars,my own personal theory   spoilers  max von sydow s characters importance and how that ties kylo ren  luke skywalker  and rey s origins together  i do not know how well known this is  but not all jedi are warriors in the prequels we see that one of the jedi  jocasta nu  who tells obiwan that kamino does not exist is a librariankeeper of the archives this is what i believe max von sydow s character  lor san tekka was for the academy luke started via the visual dictionary  lor san tekka is explained to be the leader of the church of the force  a group who believe in and follow the jedi s teachings i believe luke recruited him to come and preserve all that had happened over the last 60 some years  because he had seen the jedi at the height of their power  their demise  and the rise and fall of the empire he is also a well travelled individual and i believe he found the first jedi temple  created the map  and showed luke where it was located this is further cemented by in the opening scene of the movie when kylo makes a comment about lor s age and lor responds by saying he knew him before he was kylo this exchange puts them in the same place at the same time and i do not think that both of them being involved with the force is a coincidence they had to have been somewhere together where the teachings of the force were being preserved and taught again  hence luke s academy furthermore lor also has the piece of the map to luke  which luke must have entrusted to him after kylo ren destroyed the academy now here is the interesting part  rey was a member of the jedi academy or was a newly found force sensitive in her vision after touching the light saber she is seen crying for her family only after witnessing kylo and the kotr destroy the academy the sequence of events of the vision make sense and would be an amazing job by jj at dropping subtle hints to her origins if true after the slaughter of the academy luke has either just found rey and is about to bring her to the academy or he had already found her and she had been there for a short time before the raid either way luke met up with lor san tekka  after the raid  and they decided to hide her on jakku where lor san tekka would watch over her with his disciples and guard the piece of the map to skywalker and the 1st jedi temple the only difference is that if she had previously been at the academy luke would have wiped to her mind using the force so that she would be safe from the first order from discovering her luke then headed for the 1st jedi temple and asked lor san tekka to guard the last piece rey has no relation to any previous characters  which is not the reason luke stares at her with emotion at the end the leaked script states that he is looking at her with a kindness in his eyes but a torture too  and that she does nt need to speak because he knows why she is there this is more truth that rey is reminding him of his failed apprentice  slaughtered academy  and that he now knows what must be done to save the galaxy 
1520,starwars,it was love that drove anakin down the path to the dark side hence why jedi s are forbidden to love although kylo s path is nt  as far as we know  caused by love  there are different reasons to one wanting to join the dark side and one of those reasons is the quest for pure power which seems to be the angle kylo is working 
1521,starwars,i ve been indoctrinating my gf s niece too she s just over 3 will watch anh on repeat she loves darth vader   he s the bad guy  
1522,starwars,i figured it was just that the shooting on skellig michael for ep viii was done at the same time as ep vii due to the constraints of the location and so they shot a bunch of shots for ep viii when they were there doing the ep vii ending   cos weather and approvals for the location would possibly preclude going back too easily 
1523,starwars,that captain terrex looks like he could be an awesome villain he looks like he means business i wonder if he is part of the first order s special forces 
1524,starwars,on my last viewing of the movie  this was absolutely my thought process  i feel like the final scene was added because they felt like luke had to at least make a small appearance 
1525,starwars,i know what you re going through hang in there my dad has terminal pancreatic cancer and is coming towards the end we went to go see the force awakens together and it was amazingly powerful so thankful for star wars 
1526,starwars,good to see appreciation for the storyline and not just general dismissal of the prequels  until we know more about kylo and his motivations  the turning of anakin to the dark side will always be the shade kylo sits in  we ve seen his strength in the force with his blaster bolt freeze yet his saber skills and lack of finesse showcase the long road he has to travel to rival his grandfather in power he lacks vader s conviction because he feels entitled  i am very curious about how the training of kylo and rey will affect the next time they meet 
1527,starwars,that s so freaking cool 
1528,starwars,phase ii clone helmet gt  first order stormtrooper helmet gt  phase i clone helmet gt  imperial stormtrooper helmet  anyone agree 
1529,starwars,yeah same my sister died just before christmas and my grandma s in the hospital it s nice to have something to get lost in 
1530,starwars,the ending of vii is not the same as the scene here daisy definitely looks a little older and her face a bit more sunburnt and mark hamill has more grey hair at the end of vii the scene was shot 2 different times  likely months apart 
1531,starwars,so is this canon now 
1532,starwars,you know  hux is really the commander just like how grand moff tarkin was and not vader 
1533,starwars,looks like a disney infinity character  got ta say  i would finally take the plunge and buy the game if we could play as matt 
1534,starwars,oh hey  there s that dude on the force awakens poster that no one recognized 
1535,starwars,i have nt had ma muffin  yet  matt 
1536,starwars,im lost i thought the first two were both republic  different symbols  is that different eras  or what 
1537,starwars,can we let this die already
1538,starwars,people keep saying matt is kylo ren when he s clearly not i mean his name is matt and he just so happened to find kylo ren s lightsaber  use force powers  happens to know what people are thinking and oh my goddid that woman ever get her muffin  so yeah  matt totally is nt kylo ren 
1539,starwars,op  did you draw this 
1540,starwars,is there a way to slow it down  see the transition more gradually and view the helmets longer 
1541,starwars,need an stl file for this stat 
1542,starwars,lot of good stuff coming  side note  do you think the main series will eventually lead into esb and beyond  could be interesting 
1543,starwars, i ai nt had my muffin yet    matt     
1544,starwars,i want to buy this  
1545,starwars,i ve been learning zbrush i tried to mimic the disney infinity style for people who do nt know about matt  here s a link    <URL>  v  s74breonakc
1546,starwars,i m 90  sure this is a kylo ren statue
1547,starwars,who is this 
1548,starwars,i knew from  hey  i m matt 
1549,starwars,lando
1550,starwars,looks like jeff dahmer
1551,starwars,if only was a playable character in the disney star wars infinity 
1552,starwars,why are we not talking about lukes voice  that s not mark hammil either that or i m going completely insane 
1553,starwars,good god  the uncanny valley
1554,starwars,my question is  how did the clone trooper s armor get so dirty so fast  i mean  was nt that the very first engagement of the very first battalion of the clone army  sure there s dust everywhere  but the clone s gear is already weathered  nicked and scraped but would nt all their gear be practically brand new  i do nt get it 
1555,starwars,why are the laats the best ships 
1556,starwars,probably the opposite considering the order these things came about 
1557,starwars,it s simultaneously sad and amazing that i can hardly tell the difference between this and the clone wars animated series
1558,starwars,it just occurred to me that the death star is a bigger republic gunship turret 
1559,starwars,i know people do nt like the prequels  but god i love the war scenes even if it looks terrible 
1560,starwars,i want to see snoke be the emperor and have him fight
1561,starwars,i d enjoy a non cg villain 
1562,starwars,  <URL>  itok  l0sfn_fq meanwhile poor old poe s poster does nt keep the consistency   someone photoshop an xwing 
1563,starwars,an actual war in the stars ships battling one another on the scale of the land battles in lotr  return of the king 
1564,starwars,much like maul  little jedi padawan ekons used his hatred to survive the wounds dealt to him crawling from the ruins of the jedi temple  ekons managed to stow aboard a transport bound for the unknown regions there  he began his rehabilitation into snokepromising to return the vengeance dealt to him by darth vader by destroying the chosen one s descendants and extinguishing the skywalker lineage for good  or whatever  you know  and a very big thank you to the person who bestowed upon me the gift of reddit gold 
1565,starwars,if anyone has nt seen it  deadpool is totally worth the trip to the theater it s definitely a hard  r  rating though but man  was it so good if you were a fan of him in the comics 
1566,starwars,i absolutely hate the fact that fin is holding a saber  in the promotional images and also the movie itself 
1567,starwars,someone picked a bad day to sculpt the face of the geonosian queen 
1568,starwars, its happening        youtubeqyjbpfqv1wq 
1569,starwars,luke got more screentime in this promo than he did in episode vii 
1570,starwars,i misspelled  i was very  very confused for about two seconds    <URL>
1571,starwars,please how do i make this a poster
1572,starwars,getting those spam follows and retweets i see 
1573,starwars,mark hamill really seems to be pushing his performance boundaries from what we ve seen so far 
1574,starwars,where do i sign  
1575,starwars, tfa spoilers   s  when phasma does more in a six minute animated lego short than the entirety of episode vii  
1576,starwars,i loved the whole thing except poe s voice it s a bit off to me 
1577,starwars,3d printed 
1578,starwars,luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke luke
1579,starwars,i know this is nt final  but i find it interesting that the lighting in the clip is very different to the lighting that we see in the last scene of tfa but yeah i know that this will most definitely change  still  that shot of luke was just breathtaking 
1580,starwars,just wanted to share with other fans before it gets lost in oblivion on my hard drive there are some parts missing because they d have led into a sequel that i never ended up writing because as i discovered  this was a lot of work for free but it s a pretty complete and self contained story and i got a lot out of the process i love star wars  love obi wan  and love writing  so this was a true labor of love if i ever had one so here it is  my ideal star wars  and more importantly  my ideal obi wan kenobi story
1581,starwars,there has to be some successful city on tatooine 
1582,starwars,well  we ve now officially seen more of episode <SMILE> than we have rogue one 
1583,starwars,i honestly hope they stray from the kind of fan service dished out in the pt i would be more than satisfied if i never saw someone wield two or double bladed lightsabers again maul was cool  but then the whole thing became garish trying to top maulgrievous was downright fucking ridiculous 
1584,starwars,excellent allow the force to flow through you carrying away all that is hurtful the buddhists call it meditation just to try  breathe into your gut first then your chest and i feel for you 
1585,starwars,i fucking love the phase ii clone trooper mask it s my favorite to date 
1586,starwars,do you have hd versions of the helmets  they look really nice  
1587,starwars,was nt the republic insignia <SMILE> spokes 
1588,starwars,i do nt know how i felt about storm troopers being people and not dispensable pawns that occasionally said funny things 
1589,starwars,that is amazing you should make more star wars animations
1590,starwars,awesome work there
1591,starwars,can you make a version without the blood  seemed unnecessary  has nothing to do with finn 
1592,starwars,do you have the stock pictures 
1593,starwars,these always move a bit too fast for me excellent regardless
1594,starwars,in the near future  the  star wars  fanbase will most definitely be uniformly overweight due to how often we get fed not only do we get amazingly produced content by the man  but we also get talented content created by fellow fans  it s practically a  golden corral     <URL>  v  va0rznkmblk  in here 
1595,starwars,is there an explanation for the different sigils in the top right  that is  why they have a particular number of spokes etc  sort of like the us flag has 13 stripes for the original colonies  50 stars for the 50 states  etc 
1596,starwars,too bad that even with storm trooper gear  imperial troops can get their asses kicked by teddy bears with sticks  also  great animation 
1597,starwars,this is amazing has anyone here edited this and slowed the animation down  i wonder what that would look like 
1598,starwars,the shifting banners really makes it that much better 
1599,starwars,is there an explanation for the original colonies  50 stars for the whole trilogy 
1600,starwars,is there anything i can set a gif to  cause ill set the shit out of this 
1601,starwars,that looks fantastic  is that in a format that can be 3d printed   
1602,starwars,it would be cool to get this in some form of a gif to make a live photo for apple watch
1603,starwars,what happened to all of the clones after revenge of the sith  did the empire just change the name of them from clone troopers to storm troopers  also  what happened to all of the empire s troops after return of the jedi  they could nt have all joined the first order since it s known that they used abducted children for soilders 
1604,starwars,owning this adds 10 to your perception skill
1605,starwars,disney infinity 40 leak 
1606,starwars,this is fantastic  i love that you included the symbol evolution in the top corner as well  really nice work 
1607,starwars,i am an actual radar technician would anyone like to ama 
1608,starwars,meteos 
1609,starwars,this skit really was nt that funny to begin with 
1610,starwars,i love it   any way you could 3d print that 
1611,starwars,omg i want one 
1612,starwars,whatup    matt   
1613,starwars,team fortress expansion character 
1614,starwars,if you can get me a copy of the file for this i will 3dprint it for you preferably in stl  or obj i d love to play around with this model 
1615,starwars,pop  why are you not making this  
1616,starwars,thanks for letting it up to us you dudes are the best
1617,starwars,which one s which  haha predictable jokes  p
1618,starwars,i would actually enjoy that  i think 
1619,starwars,look at snoke s mouth and then imagine him saying  master skywalker  there are too many of them what are we going to do  
1620,starwars,supreme leader random kid  47 
1621,starwars,sure anakin was a dick for killing those kids  but what about the jedi charged with protecting them   let s get the fuck out of here    what about the younglings    fuck the younglings 
1622,starwars,snoke is jar jar sure  he had a really bad face transplant after episode iii to avoid being hunted by vader  but he learned to accept and even love his new face it took a little longer to drop the accent 
1623,starwars, spoilers   s  having kylo around would also make him hateful and angry increasing his power in the dark side  
1624,starwars,i m probably imagining it  but i can see a slight resemblance there 
1625,starwars,i m upvoting every comment just to see the little messages 
1626,starwars, rian johnson  cut  beautiful   me   aaaaaaaaaaaaaargh come on 
1627,starwars,that is what it looked like hitting the bridge floor 
1628,starwars,excluding jacen  jaina  and anakin 
1629,starwars,she was kind of busy between motherhood and politics  when do you have time to spend ten years meditating on dagobah 
1630,starwars,it looks creepy for some reason  but i like 
1631,starwars,my body is nt ready for this give me blurey edition already so i can distract myself 
1632,starwars,let s improve the atat by making it even more topheavy  brilliant 
1633,starwars,luke s looking like zues like a god
1634,starwars,one of the big reveals in <SMILE> or 9 will be her whipping out her saber 
1635,starwars,that shot of skellig michael was phenominal
1636,starwars,there had been leaked shots from skelling michael way back in september  but this is the first time that i ve realized that there might not be  any  time passing inuniverse between episodes they re certainly making it seem like rian johnson is shooting the very next scene after the end of tfa 
1637,starwars,it s certainly scary do nt know how efficient
1638,starwars,jango art    yussss 
1639,starwars,what species 
1640,starwars,i just hate that they brought him back and needed to say it  i mean come on him being alive takes away from quigons death and obiwans status as the first to kill a sith in a thousand years its more silly than the clone luke and clone emperor since they at least had reasonable plot reasons to exist it was just a money grab to bring back a well liked character heck the whole clone wars plays off jango s popularity but people do nt complain about them being clones or anything  i wont get into what they did to the dathomiri and night sisters but maul being raised by them and being some kind of warrior for them yeah sure what ever and now hes going to be in rebels and you all crap on the eu so much why do nt you call out tcw and rebels for its crap 
1641,starwars,gt  clone wars gt  gt  money grab wut 
1642,starwars,it was a mistake to bring him back  and it was a mistake to kill him maul should have been the trilogy villain until anakin took his place as vader  but they missed that opportunity and are trying to keep his story going  which i dislike as well
1643,starwars,you must not be familiar with much eu stuff then 
1644,starwars,gt  him being alive takes away from quigons death and obiwans status as the first to kill a sith in a thousand years  him being alive takes away from darth maul  let s be perfectly clear heredarth maul is the prequels  boba fett a bad ass character with only a few lines  scant screen time  and then he was dead  lucas managed to strike gold not once  but twice a secondary character was the coolest thing ever  and then managed to ruin it  rule number one in entertainment is  always leave the audience wanting more  darth maul was that if he never had another second of screen time he d have secured his place in the pantheon of memorable star wars characters 
1645,starwars,i loved darth maul in tcw  however i agree that the act of bringing him back was pretty legendsish i m pretty sure it s also at least partially based off an eu story  specifically the spider leg design  i survived because lololol dark side op   it falls under the same category as dark empire palpatine s clones and vitiatevalkorion in tor possessing everyone to come back to life 
1646,starwars,this <URL> many of the reasons i love star wars very cool 
1647,starwars, but they filmed at skellig michael in 2014     <URL>  it will probably be a while until we have real clarity as to why rian shot this again 
1648,starwars,good thing disney took over then
1649,starwars,its the thought that counts 
1650,starwars,this is so cute
1651,starwars,jedi academy is freaking awesome 
1652,starwars,tmnt thong 
1653,starwars,leia chose not to  and instead focused on her political and military duties 
1654,starwars,also another bit of symbolism with kylo ren s lightsaber  it s all sparky and crackly  as if to represent his role as a sith he s a very strong sith  and very powerful  but also he s very unsure of his abilities  as we see with his obsession with darth vader and him wanting to be as strong as vader  meaning he does nt believe he is as strong as him i think the sparkiness of the saber was intentional 
1655,starwars,yes one of my alltime favourite star wars games really good levels  fun force powers  fun lightsaber combat  and you get to build your own lightsaber  yes it s old  but it still holds up  and it has a huge modding community even just fiddling with the command console can be quite fun 
1656,starwars,much respect to him lt  3 may the force be with him 
1657,starwars,that is amazing  mate 
1658,starwars, laura dern is in the new star wars       <URL> 
1659,starwars,i know what i m doing with my terrarium this weekend 
1660,starwars,this is the kind of stuff i m hopeful to see in the spin off  anthology  films star wars stories that are nt told from the perspective of two or three jedi
1661,starwars,funny how two slaves seem to live in a better home than these people 
1662,starwars,sorry it looks like a twilek butt
1663,starwars,i have nt played it in years  but i liked it a lot back in the day plus  i ve heard that in the years since people have created some really amazing mods for it 
1664,starwars,fantastic job
1665,starwars,play outcast first or dark forces even 
1666,starwars,jedi knight 2 is like the best star wars game ever made get that  and also get academy since it s fun too  never came any game so close to resemble actual lightsaber fighting  you will really be suprised  the mp is a lot of fun  i ran them both very good on windows 10  you just have to enter the resolution manually into the config for widescreen 
1667,starwars,i thought it was really fun the levels are relatively straightforward  not as much puzzle solving and key finding like my favorite sw game jedi knight and jedi knight 2   you have a list of missions  pick one  and go do it it s got some really cool levels  mainly wanted to highlight that each level is in a different place  with a few repeats so it does nt get tedious and there s other neat features i do nt want to spoil  but it s fun  and you  kinda  get to design a character you are nt stuck playing a predesigned jedi  ca nt comment on resolution problems  but windows 10 has certainly had its share of graphics problems for older games 
1668,starwars,yes 
1669,starwars,i hope that cake is nt  fett  free 
1670,starwars,i would suggest at least starting with jedi knight 2  jedi outcast i think it s the better of the two when it comes to the single player experience  in terms of story  characters and levels the gameplay is pretty much the same in both games with a few differences  but yes  if you have the chance  i <URL> getting it preferably both they are the best games in my opinion when it comes to lightsaber combat by far and it just gets better and better the more you play around with the saber combat jedi outcast is a game i keep coming back to  and i never get tired of it gameplay wise they ve aged very well  as for resolution problems  it s only that there s no widescreen resolutions in the options menu however  you can apply whatever resolutions you want through a few simple console commands you can find them on the games  pc gaming wiki page     <URL>  _jedi_knight_ii_  _jedi_outcast   along with some other nifty configurations and  here s     <URL>  _jedi_knight_  _jedi_academy  the page for jedi academy  jedi outcast is still my all time favorite star wars game  gameplay wise i hope you get as much enjoyment out of them as i ve done  if you decide to get them 
1671,starwars,what s with these mean comments  well at least she tried   good job op s gf
1672,starwars,how about a prequel to jurassic park instead 
1673,starwars,at least 9 months  since padme announced her pregnancy to anakin when he returned from rescuing palpatine 
1674,starwars,i love the first one 
1675,starwars,i remember when i was a little kid a star wars expo came to my area  they had a life size cockpit of the millennium falcon 
1676,starwars,looking at kylos lightsaber again there are 2 very distinct exposed wires  a blue wire and a red wire as everyone knows  the lightsaber color of choice for the sithdark side is red  and one of the main colors of lightsabers for jedi is blue on kylos lightsaber  the blue wire is very short in comparison to the red wire  symbolizing that he still has some of the light side in him  but its being over shadowed by the dark side 
1677,starwars,that s awful may he <URL> part of the living force you seem like a great friend for helping him through all of this 
1678,starwars,do not open up save forever 
1679,starwars,i will be making a trek to the antarctic to freeze myself in a glacier until this movie comes out if anyone wants to join me  please bring your own snacks and an extra alarm clock we do nt want to oversleep this time 
1680,starwars,i actually just watched this webisode today
1681,starwars,heeeeeeeere s benny 
1682,starwars,i m on board with luke being a badass jedi master and training rey and all that  but what i specifically want to see from the beginning of viii is luke interacting with chewie  i mean he has nt seen the guy  guy  wookiee  since he went into hiding  or maybe even longer considering how long ago han left leia also han  just  died i would really like to see chewie s reaction to luke and luke s reaction to the news 
1683,starwars,the sixbreasted one  or the rebel leader one 
1684,starwars,i want to believe 
1685,starwars,that s a fear i ve not felt in a long time  a long time 
1686,starwars,it s so dense 
1687,starwars, we re gon na see him fight with that laser sword 
1688,starwars,lol hilarious
1689,starwars, noooooooooooooooooooooo     <URL> 
1690,starwars,i cringed 
1691,starwars,it s gon na be great 
1692,starwars,no one going to mention him writing on a red valentine with red crayon   okay  just me then 
1693,starwars,jango is a mandalorian and putting an imposter in a battle would be considered cowardly 
1694,starwars,why would they do that   so you went to japan this summer and i d love to buy some china 
1695,starwars,oh she s in some college humor skits she s in star wars well good for her 
1696,starwars,i guess with his age  anakin got used to sand 
1697,starwars,new ships and new  alien worlds
1698,starwars, no more drugs for you honey  
1699,starwars,i meant to save all my kotor art to post together when i finish but it  s taken too long and i got bored so here  s my reimagining of juhani it  s been on the backburner while i work on other work stuff like commissions and the rest of the kotor crew previous research indicated that she  s wellhated  and i think her design was not very good  so i decided to reign in some of the more extreme decisions made by the bioware team i think she had a lot of cool potential  so i tried to make her less of a weird furry and more of a bad bitch  specs  i painted this entirely in 2d in photoshop on a cintiq tablet final file is 9k px tall and 44gb preexport hundreds of layers  i don  t feel like counting yes  that means it  s  not a real painting   it  s a digital painting it probably took over a hundred hours  though i don  t count anymore my brushes are from many sources including the most popular and famous brushsets out there  such as jaime jones   maciej kuciara  s  shaddy safadi  s  and plenty of custom ones i have a little folder of like twenty favourite brushes that i do 95  of my painting with  please hit me with any questions or input you have  thanks for looking 
1700,starwars,i m trying to see it  but i m failing 
1701,starwars,instagram  briankesinger
1702,starwars,ha   also the ant queen from a bug s life
1703,starwars,buying dishes in japan is one of my favourite things about visiting 
1704,starwars,the stupid head nod joke between finn and han that happens on starkiller base when han spots rey climbing the wall over finn s shoulder makes me cringe every time i think about it that was way worse than any jar jar moment 
1705,starwars,why would they do that   so you went to japan for 2 weeks in the beginning of april 
1706,starwars,i m going to japan to buy some china 
1707,starwars,from what i gathered  they brainwash children to be totally obedient and emotionless drones whereas clone had their inhibitor chips finn s brainwashing failed for some random reason at some random time it s flimsy  but that s the story 
1708,starwars,i agree  i thought it was super cheesy the stories themselves were mediocre and not worth ruining a character whose entire popularity is based on his mystery tcw casts him as a railthin dude with bad teeth and a dopey little brother  and it s not a good look 
1709,starwars,i did nt really understand that you could make her a companion on my first play through  straight up killed her 
1710,starwars,i do nt think the choice to do it was bad  but i think the execution was him suddenly appearing in clone wars with weird cybernetic spider legs was just a bad decision if he had somehow been rescued while still on naboo and reconstructed more like anakin s transformation into darth vader  that would have been more acceptable his hatred keeping him alive is basically just a copout and asks me to suspend my disbelief too far 
1711,starwars,they re left out in the sun too long and spoil 
1712,starwars,looks like that assassin from tcw  i ca nt recall her name  she worked with boba
1713,starwars,luke never went bad  leia never went bad  shmi never went bad  there s more good than bad 
1714,starwars,so i see a lot of assumptions about why kylo may have gone bad  and almost all of them make the assumption that he did for power  or out of jealousy of someone else s  usually rey s  power  or some such idea  i do nt think that will end up being the reason  so why do skywalkers go bad  or almost bad in luke s case   only one reason  love they lose it when the people they love are threatened  luke  or in serious danger  anakin   i think in ix we will learn that ben has a very good reason for what he did that reason may not actually be true  like anakin s belief in the power to save padme  but he will believe it  in addition to this fitting with the themes of star wars generally  i think this also makes more sense within what we know of kylo from tfa i m guessing people assume his fall was due to a lust for power because of rey s statement that he is afraid that he is nt as strong as vader but the word choice is important here she says  strong  not  powerful   his motivation is nt power  but strength there is a subtle  but important difference between the two  and a search for strength makes sense in the context of wanting to protect someone or something he loves  i also think that this would explain the unstable  conflicted aspect of kylo s character he believes he must hold to the dark side for some reason  he must finish what he thinks vader started  but it is not his natural inclination  and it causes him enormous pain and conflict 
1715,starwars,this is a funny little problem with the story i only recently noticed myselfalthough the redemption of vader and death of the emperor is the emotional climax of the film and series it actually does nt really change the <URL> except for luke himself if luke had turned to the dark side  he would have just been blown up with the rest of the death star  i did nt recognize it as such back in the day  but timothy zahn s heir to the empire has a little retcon hack to fix the  problem  thrawn at one point explains that the emperor was boosting his troops with the force until he was killed once he died  the efficiency of the imperial fleet plummeted and the executor was blown upand if you watch the film with this in mind the timing totally lines up  all three storylines turn favorable for the rebels at the same time so in the old legends canon at least  the death of the emperor was key to the rebel victory 
1716,starwars,i wish tfa would ve talked more about the political landscape of the galaxy i know they re trying to stay away from the overpoliticized prequel feel but a bit more detail about the first order  resistance  and new republic would be nice and could go a long way  in the novelvisual dictionary it s explained that the first order has been playing possum and the new republic  along with the rest of the galaxy  does nt take them seriously  hence why poe is so surprised when he arrives in the star destroyer and sees legions of stormtroopers and tie fighters   it also suggests the new republic is struggling to keep control of the galaxy  and even implies that there are a few corrupt members of the new republic who want leia dead  which is why she runs the resistance and why she really wants to find luke  this all could ve been conveyed in a few lines and would ve given the audience a better understanding of how the empire is back all of a sudden and why the rebels seem to be back at square one 
1717,starwars,i d put myself somewhere in the movie 
1718,starwars,during the raekylo lightsaber battle  i would have liked there to be more of an explanation to how she tapped into the force i think the only thing i would add would be a soft whisper  rae  by luke during that moment when she feels the force  the force being awoken in rey and luke finding it 
1719,starwars,gt  i also dislike the shot they do use  looks like from a helicopter or a drone i agree with that it felt very unstar wars  the only change i would make would be to the resistance i would have had leia and ackbar as joint chiefs in the new republic starfleet and army convinced of the danger of the first order but dismissed by the other joint chiefs and the senate  only to be proven right when the starkiller base destroys the hosnian system dqar could have just as easily been a republic base poe could have been republic special forces it would nt have affected the narrative at all to just have them as regular military the whole idea of the resistance seemed contrived when they were nt at war to begin with 
1720,starwars,that s a great one that last shot was  well  i ca nt think of another  better word it was dumb 
1721,starwars,i d rather have luke to say this in the ending scene luke  there was a hand toodid you bring the hand   
1722,starwars,i think it was just too fast i do nt mind the helicopter shot circling them  but it was moving too fast if they slow it down it s easier to comprehend what s happening  i think they wanted luke and rey in the final shot  which i think is a good call i would have gone with a side shot where ones on the right  other on the left 
1723,starwars,prerots i was always under the impression dooku was the most powerful force user known  aside from yoda and sidious 
1724,starwars,that s so awesome  congrats to your friend  i feel like i know her by extension  so i expect a red carpet invite 
1725,starwars,i agree  however  the very last shot i wished it would have ended on luke s  traumatised  face  if it had just cut to black i think it would have been a lot better and maybe more mysterious i also dislike the shot they do use  looks like from a helicopter or a drone  i think it just took some of the weight away from luke and rey  and a little bad overall 
1726,starwars,absolutely  i keep telling my mates that but they do nt listen it seems a bit too disney  for me  if you know what i mean 
1727,starwars,it was an awkward shot because they lingered for so long and spun too much it should ve just zoomed in on the island and showed a cloaked luke as the falcon descends and then cut to black 
1728,starwars,that s awesome  
1729,starwars,i m thinking its more simple  that the shot we saw in the announcement was just a shot for the episode <SMILE> trailer  not necessarily the movie there were plenty of shots in the tfa trailers we did not get in the movie  i felt like this is one for episode <SMILE> to set up the beginning of one of their trailers 
1730,starwars,man fuck the mask where the hell did you get that quinn poster    
1731,starwars,  excuse me miss do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior darth vader  
1732,starwars,this would make a great cover for a comic series detailing ben s fall to the dark side please make that happen  btw 
1733,starwars,i absolutely love the detail and colouring in this 
1734,starwars,i immediately thought this artwork was a play off of this unfortunate sw addition   <URL>
1735,starwars,so did the first clone helmets have no capacity for life support 
1736,starwars,very cool  what do you use to create the animation  this one and the f1 evolution  
1737,starwars, and he has nt cut off my hand with a lightsaber 
1738,starwars,this is adorable on a more serious note though  it s kind of creepy how many people ship kylo ren and rey like how much do you have to hate rey to condemn her to that 
1739,starwars,the blood at the end did nt really make sense considering the context 
1740,starwars,great work so much good 
1741,starwars,i so want to melt him on a light bulb just to get him closer to his grandpa 
1742,starwars,i would hope they d rework some of the controls as well  combat worked fine but movement is painful 
1743,starwars,husband and i took our five year old daughter to see tfa i allowed her to go dressed in her princess leia costume and i wore my jedi robe waiting for the movie to start  she turns to her dad and says  i m always going to remember this 
1744,starwars, it s not going to last very long     <URL> 
1745,starwars,i am so honored

1748,starwars,i love the games but they have nt aged well 
1749,starwars,if piccolo in some sexy lingerie is your jam  happy birthday  
1750,starwars,was anyone else bothered by the fact that han solo could just come in at light speed and infiltrate the base and get past the shields  it just made it look like anyone could do it i mean i know it s the han solo but still idk it s just the only thing that bothered me about tfa 
1751,starwars,such an easy way to make our day  
1752,starwars,thumbs up  niles   
1753,starwars,looks awesome op 
1754,starwars,very cool maybe a few ewoks could jazz up a future woodsie find 
1755,starwars,you tweet too much  ca nt be good for the psyche 
1756,starwars,undefeated   gets defeated by a blind man calling out his name 
1757,starwars,do nt you mean poester boy 
1758,starwars,nice  goes along with that godlike bastila of yours   i never understood people s hate towards juhani though  she s an amazing character  disturbed yet refined  and redeemed in the end  looking forward to the rest of the crew  keep up the good work 
1759,starwars,more shots of finn and poe holding hands maybe a little smoocheroo 
1760,starwars,i love when people do this  well done op
1761,starwars,you called 
1762,starwars,because of certain situations i could not go see the movie until a good few days after it s release even then though  i roamed the internet with great caution you just have to be careful  now the film is barely in cinemas anymore and i think most people that are going to see it  would have by now certainly those that visit this site waiting for the bluray release is nt going to change that  i say everything spoiler is fair game  especially for the star wars subreddit 
1763,starwars,i vote everything about tfa  or any released thing  is fair game 
1764,starwars,as others have said  if you did nt see it in theaters and are on a sw subreddit  you are going to have a bad time i understand certain situations have prevented people from seeing it in theaters  which sucks  but if those people were nt able to see it for the nearly 2 months it was in most theaters  they probably wont be able to rush out the day the dvd comes out 
1765,starwars,dumb ass
1766,starwars,everything spoiler about tfa is fair game  come on the movie is out if people have nt seen it  thats their own fault
1767,starwars,you keep switching sides and it makes me irrationally mad 
1768,starwars,  <URL>  v  zs1j3vrxnm0
1769,starwars,lol if the deep face along does not get you gig i do nt know what will  p
1770,starwars,if you re as tall as her you could get a job in star wars as her stand in 
1771,starwars,aaaaaaaaaa 
1772,starwars,i like george  and this is still funny 
1773,starwars,goongas for episode viii confirmed 
1774,starwars,hahahaha have an upvote please
1775,starwars,george does nt know there s that much green in all of the galaxy 
1776,starwars,am i the only one who thought this was the scariest thing they ve seen in a while 
1777,starwars,is it just me or does leia look a lot more like patame in that picture 
1778,starwars,that s actually a brilliant idea george lucas missed out 
1779,starwars,the question i have regarding that scene is why luke s artificial hand has no skin also  why is it of a dark color material  if i remember correctly the one shown on the previous movie was shinny 
1780,starwars,twist  she s going to be the major villain in ep ix i will call it epix from now on 
1781,starwars,bwing  admiral wedge  rey needing to recreate the kessel run for some great jedi temple treasure hunt reason
1782,starwars,yeah i guess i can see general leia in that
1783,starwars,that s terrifying but awesome 
1784,starwars,really cool man off topic i always wondered why obi wan doesnt recognize r2 and 3po in anh on tattoine anyways  rad poster dude 
1785,starwars,fantastic  it s beautiful image 
1786,starwars,that s pretty awesome would you be willing to share your files with me 
1787,starwars,well despite being the whole redeeming vader thing it was established in the legends continuity that as soon as the emperor died the whole fleet management collapsed since he was using some sort of battlemeditation to control the battle so if luke would nt have killed him the battle could have gone the other way but i do nt know about the canon continuity  
1788,starwars,oh man  those are great 
1789,starwars,may i ask where you got these  i ll be going to japan this summer and i d love to buy them 
1790,starwars,just another victim of poor paint application in the 6 inch black series line 
1791,starwars,the irony that marks profile pic isnt even a bearded him
1792,starwars,the very last shot i wished it would have ended on luke s  traumatised  face  if it had just cut to black i think it would have been a lot better and maybe more mysterious i also dislike the shot they do use  looks like from a helicopter or a drone  i think it just took some of the weight away from luke and rey  and a little bad overall  what small changes would you make 
1793,starwars,i d change the way we find out that han is kylo ren s father having snoke drop it into conversation like that felt weirdly anticlimactic you could have him just saying  han solo   followed by kylo ren tensing up slightly and saying his  he means nothing to me  line and then we find out the whole story when han and leia are talking about their son at the resistance base 
1794,starwars,there are pipe dreams and then there s a drug induced coma 
1795,starwars,i was reading somewhere that the film should have ended with reyr2chewie going into lightspeed in the falcon because that would have been more of a true sw ending  i sort of agree much more mysterious and ballsy to not even show luke start with that instead not sure if they start with lukerey meeting now because usually some time skips between films 
1796,starwars,remove starkiller base at this point  if you re an imperial type of person you just feel empty the rebels and the resistance destroyed two death stars  a bunch of star destroyers and the majority of the first order along with the starkiller base with a bunch of xwings and a ridiculous fleet the planet add nothing to the story  i would have taken a page out of eu and the first order would be akin to thrawn without thrawn overall it would make more sense and they would have looked more terrifying 
1797,starwars,why the fucking fuck fuck does chewie walk past leia at the end         that made the least sense of all  tfa   s  chewie s best friend  brother  lifelong compatriot has just died why in god s name would he not rush to comfort and be comforted by a woman who is by any measure that matters his sister  the grief that chewie and leia should have been feeling in that moment is massive instead  nah  imma just go stand awkwardly next to these dudes who are taking care of some kid i ve know for a week yeah that sounds like a plan   
1798,starwars,smoke me a kipper  i ll be back for breakfast 
1799,starwars,the change i would make would be to not have  tfa   s  starkiller base explode    this makes it a more of a carbon copy of the previous movies  i d rather have it crippled as a useless paperweight and have it as a small deviation from the previous movies also  the final scene of tfa could have been  at most  a postcredit scene since it was nt necessary  the movie should have ended at the lightspeed scene
1800,starwars,unde   fett   ed
1801,starwars,i agree with the top comment  i believe everything is fair game i totally understand if somehow someone has nt seen it but if you have nt yet do nt browse a star wars hub 
1802,starwars,now that the movie s been out for 2 months  it s not like there are nt spoilers  everywhere else on the internet  the  big one  has 57 million google results  trying to  protect  people from spoilers here is like plugging a single hole in a dam with your finger when someone already used dynamite on the rest of it 
1803,starwars,i d say wait until dvdbluray release  i understand some people ca nt make the theatres  either they re broke  work too much  or have young kids   but once it s released on dvdbr  there is absolutely no excuse for a fan to miss out 
1804,starwars,while you do an incredible impersonation of laura  you also remind me a bit of wynn everett from agent carter
1805,starwars,in before the awakening i remember something about frequent sandstorms routinely changing the terrain on jakku  allowing different crashed things to be uncovered and i mean i say i remember something about that that s actually the crux of the plot of rey s story thinking about it
1806,starwars,this looks like if a eldrazi became an atat really cool 
1807,starwars,dad goals
1808,starwars,you think that s good parenting    really  making her all tired for school the next morning probably ca nt concentrate  probably getting bad grades you bet your midichlorians it is  
1809,starwars,is she gon na grow a beard too
1810,starwars,any time someone fallscrashes and would normally be dead in real life  take a shot 
1811,starwars,i value my liver dude
1812,starwars,take a shot any time anakin gets electrocuted 
1813,starwars,oo  another one take a drink whenever someone gets lightsabered through the chest 
1814,starwars,what did i just watch
1815,starwars,take a drink any time a jedi dies and everybody acts all sad  but nobody cares when a clone dies 
1816,starwars,i understand if someone s life situation has prevented them from going to theaters in 2 months  but they should nt browse a star wars forum if they have nt 
1817,starwars,it s all downhill from here 
1818,starwars,i wish i looked enough like a cast member to audition the acting is just a plus  i just wan na read that damn script 
1819,starwars,mudstick  slimy  my boner this is 
1820,starwars,that yoda has seen some shit 
1821,starwars,best mods on reddit you guys are awesome for being open to change 
1822,starwars,someone explain wtf i m looking at
1823,starwars,carlos lieberman would be proud 
1824,starwars,nah you re prettier and have a chin but  do you sound like you were born deaf 
1825,starwars,soooo when rey will be an old  wise master jedi  she ll have a beard too 
1826,starwars,i made vaders a few months ago and tried adding some redlight sources along an extruded tube i m on mobile right now but i ll post them later
1827,starwars,  there is no chaos  there is harmony      <URL>  1 
1828,starwars,how did you animate this  looks really cool
1829,starwars,maybe it s just me  but i ve never really liked that light saber too much imo it looks like a flashlight with the battery cartridge on the side and minus the thin tube at the very tip  it looks like an odd flashlight  of course  it still looks very accurate so good job on making it 
1830,starwars,this is absolutely incredible very well done 
1831,starwars,found me a new boot animation thanks 
1832,starwars,neat
1833,starwars,i know this is rstarwars  but the key thing here is with him kids love it when you share experiences and do things that  include  them  whatever it is  especially if you talk about it  what you like  do nt like   the fact that you are watching such great movies together makes it even more cool for her  but doing the dishes or going to the supermarket is almost as cool as long as she s involved  source  learnt this from a justtoberetired nursery teacher who had like 45 years of experience with young kids she said it was the most important thing she had learned it s not necessarily what you do together  it s how much you include them in the experience 
1834,starwars,this post is worth60 portions
1835,starwars,if you printed it i d buy it 
1836,starwars,if you re looking for the next step up from there and are having a little difficulty with a graflex based design like anakin s  you might want to try obi wan s anh saber it s similar enough to luke s  but will give you some practice with assemblies and more complex parts    <URL> great job 
1837,starwars,this is too cool man  could you make wallpapers out of these     
1838,starwars,a more likely candidate for snoke 
1839,starwars,han s weapon and face look a bit off like they photoshopped two images of harrison ford s face together it looks like each side of his face is looking at the camera from a different angle 
1840,starwars,definetly not tatooine do you know why 
1841,starwars,utapau
1842,starwars,i would open it  i mean  it was a gift from your gf
1843,starwars,what is homer simpson doing on the stock 
1844,starwars,or there are scenes with luke and rey on skellig in episode viii i m sure she will be there for a while training as a jedi i m sure they did multiple takes from multiple angles for the ending shot in episode vii  they probably just used one of those  also hamill was grew a beard for his role the force awakens we know it was specifically for the force awakens because he shaved it off right after shooting was done no way was luke going to be excluded from tfa the entire movie leads up to that last shot 
1845,starwars,drink any time a blaster is fired at a jedi and the shot misses 
1846,starwars,okay  i think they just remade this scene for the trailer all the other stuff that gets recorded their does have a time gap between episode 7 and <SMILE> 
1847,starwars,yes  when i read that they were shooting at skellig michael in september  i did wonder if it was a last minute addition to ep vii and not an early shoot for viii the former makes more sense  after all  jj was still putting together his final cut of the film well into october or possibly later they must have realised that they wanted this scene at the end and they shot it last minute in sept i completely believe it 
1848,starwars,i think anakin s fall actually had more to do with guilt than anything else  he feels guilty about breaking the jedi code  so he harbours his feelings for his mother and padme instead of consulting obiwan or yoda  who could help him work through it  he feels guilty about killing dooku  so it s important for him that sheev is properly arrested and tried on top of that  sheev has been playing on his guilt over his mother and padme  then the jedi sort of rub his face in the guilt he feels over his inadequacies as a jedi there s more in the clone wars  but just in the movie  they let him on the council  but do nt give him the rank of master pretty insultinghumiliating when you think about it  then on top of that he s wracked with guilt while the jedi are hypocrites makes it easy to protect palpatine in the moment hell  mace was in some pretty questionable territory trying the execute sheev like that  after mace dies  though  anakin feels too guilty to go back to the jedi guilt  pride  and fear the hate does nt come until later  it s actually amazing to think about the events of dark disciple anyone that s read that should know that anakin really never hit the point of no return sheev used his guilt to make him feel like he had no choice  though 
1849,starwars,you may be correct 
1850,starwars,i think my heart just exploded like the death star 
1851,starwars,here s an intermediate idea i had  what if the film originally ended as you hypothesize with rey flying off  and then the scene with luke was going to be a postcredits scene  then for whatever reason they decided to put it into the movie proper 
1852,starwars,does anyone else cringe at everything deadpool  he s like an edgy middle schooler 
1853,starwars,once the empire chooses a design  they stick with that design 
1854,starwars,all i see is disney fooling the audience into thinking finn was a jedi
1855,starwars,dooku looks so stylish fighting with his hand behind his back like that 
1856,starwars,i prefer temuera morrison  i think his voice fits the character better  and it s also good for continuity s sake 
1857,starwars,ok so i like them both for their own reasons wingreen has a special place in my heart since he is the og boba and his delivery of  he s no good to me dead  is both intimidating and badass as he basically just tells vader not to fuck up i feel like morrison s delivery lacks some of that nonchalant badassery and instead <URL> more of a questioning statement regardless  morrison s voice makes a little bit more sense canonically seeing as boba is now a clone of his father now  i do nt think that even him being a clone would mean his exact diction and accent would be the same as his  fathers   boba would sound similar to jango sure but an exact copy of his voice  i find that a little hard to believe although  he sure as hell would nt sound like wingreen does having morrison voice boba makes that character lose some of the individuality that made the character so awesome  despite getting his ass eaten by a giant sand vagina  and instead makes all of his triumphs and backstory sort of piggyback on his fathers success and inherent abilities he <URL> a  knockoff  clone of his father  and not his own man ultimately  i have to go with wingreen as a better voice not because he sounds better  but because with that voice it s apparent that boba really grew to <URL> the badass bounty hunter that he was and not just trying to be his father through and through 
1858,starwars,jason wingreen  and not just because he was first his fett voice was much cooler 
1859,starwars,wingreen he fit boba as he s portrayed in  empire  far better than morrison  and there s no reason to think boba would ve kept his  kiwi  accent over time accents are nt genetic  they re environmental  shaped by the accents you hear on a daily basis it would be perfectly logical to assume boba s accent faded over time 
1860,starwars,i d still open it if you want to  misprints are nt valued nearly as much as they used to be because of the drastically increased supply  i would nt count on it to make a drastic profit or anything misprints are seen now as more of a factory error some people collect them though  so if you find a buyer you might be able to fetch something for it  cool find 
1861,starwars,i like the blood at the end 
1862,starwars,fantastic modelling  but the thumb on his left hand seems a little oddly placed to me try holding an object behind your back with your thumb in that position  it s not natural at all 
1863,starwars,this is really cool  if i may offer one suggestion  when it transitions from the final image back to the first image  i think the elements of the symbol in the upper right should spin in reverse from the way they do in every other transition like we re going backwards  instead of forward to the beginning of the animation  really nice job  this is memorizing to look at 
1864,starwars,hi guys  i m matt  the new radar tech 
1865,starwars,who s chopper 
1866,starwars,that s the republic symbol but whatever thanks to this guy below me for pointing that out
1867,starwars,there was a season 6  where can i watch it 
1868,starwars,thats awesome id love one of just the logo change from the corner too
1869,starwars,i m liking the idea of kylo ren as being driven to find the power of the dark side and <URL> worthy of darth vader s legacy  but i find kylo s  missing the boat   as it were  to be more interesting than annoying  as a lot of other people feel  it s obvious that kylo is  a  powerful in the force  and  b  utterly convinced that the dark side is the right way to go  and i think that that  combined with his obsession with being like darth vader  has a tonne of potential that we ve already started to see this is a person who is willing to do horrific things  you know what i m talking about  in order to try to gain the power level of darth vader he is already terrified of not being as powerful as the ol  dv  but there s something else there  an even deeper fear that he wo nt even let himself contemplate  what if he s wrong  what if he ll never be like darth vader   regardless  of how much he s worked and lost  what if the dark side  is nt  the path to fulfilling his potential  and never was  it would mean that everything he s done  every bit of physical and emotional agony and suffering that he has inflicted on himself  everything he gave up and destroyed in the name of furthering his power  has nt meant shit  and never will mean shit  and right now  in my 4th year of college  looking out at an uncertain future in a field i sometimes wonder if i actually want to go into  with nothing to my name but a trucktonne of student loans and four years of stress and work  that s a fear that i can completely understand 
1870,starwars,i m like 90  sure matt is kylo ren 
1871,starwars,i think they would have to credit rian as a codirector which they did not 
1872,starwars,i m glad it makes you happy  star wars makes me happy too  
1873,starwars,i m so sory you re going through this do you have people around you who support you  like a therapist  a group of friends etc  transporting to a fictional universe to forget about this life is fun and can be quite calming just do nt forget about real life completely i hope you re doing okay  i wish you the best i m glad to hear this place brings you at least some comfort 
1874,starwars,mine s earth just something special about it  
1875,starwars,may  the force     <URL>  v  hcz9kq1hzy  be with you 
1876,starwars,i dislike chopper  there i said it 
1877,starwars,inspired by   <URL>  
1878,starwars,quite easily the fugliest comic book  cover  i ve ever bought 
1879,starwars,can i get a link for the individual pictures 
1880,starwars,pitty hot 
1881,starwars,damn this scene has not aged well 
1882,starwars,i ve known ever since you said  hi i m matt 
1883,starwars, behindthescenes footage     <URL>  v  hjngrtatrdg  with jj was shot on skellig michael sorry 
1884,starwars,which just screams of bad writing because as those ships are coming in the separatists have the plans for the death star down on geonosis 
1885,starwars,p o t t e r y o t t e r y
1886,starwars,200 gold and 35 favour for a vader eh 
1887,starwars, have you heard the legend of szerakh  the silent king  
1888,starwars,the jedi in this scene do nt even look interested in the battle  edit  spelling  of course 
1889,starwars,here s why you re wrong the scene was in the shooting script and mark grew out his beard for this  then shaved it for his role in the flash then grew it again for viii why would he grow a beard because he  may  be in a scene in the movie 
1890,starwars,well  they are nt the same type of xwing  so it s not that strange that the cockpit would have a different design 
1891,starwars,just posted this on my star wars fan page on facebook gave you credit as a great dad 
1892,starwars,now that s parenting  done right 
1893,starwars,be honest  how many tears 
1894,starwars,why should i care 
1895,starwars,and i thought i was the only one 
1896,starwars,rey is worse than <SMILE>0  of legends so why pick on maul 
1897,starwars,clonetrooper phase ii will always look the coolest to me 
1898,starwars,nailed it  op 
1899,starwars,this is truly satisfying also fun to try and see combinations as it morphs really cool animation dude
1900,starwars,ca nt stop watching 
1901,starwars,if this existed  i would buy disney infinity right now
1902,starwars,i know the prequels get a lot of shit  but i love the vehicle designs in them 
1903,starwars,like poetry
1904,starwars,ffs why are we paying attention to the prequels 
1905,starwars,where s rogue one trailer doe   
1906,starwars,holy moly   love kenobi reading all of this
1907,starwars,yeah  i have to say that light speed jump was probably my least favorite part i was like  at least have her say something to chewie before they get there  nope  just popped right out 
1908,starwars,very well said  i really appreciated ren s  flawed   messy approach to darkness every other bad guy we see is so badass and calculated and inherently dark  from maul to vader to dooku and more darkness and evil seem so natural  on the other hand kylo is an impulsive  angsty  confused young man who really has to psych himself up and artificially impose darkness and passion upon himself which makes him really interesting to me 
1909,starwars,it s just as bad as vader being burned alive and surviving 
1910,starwars,with you on that it s like an old friend sorry for everything you re going through 
1911,starwars,i do the exact same thing with fictional universes  they make more sense than the real world most of the time  haha  do nt know if you want advice  but as someone who s going through a somewhat similar situation  everyone dies that s just the way of things it s more important to spend time with people while they re here so you can look back on them fondly even more important is to set things to look forward to and with your brother  i highly <URL> trying to connect with him and just be there for him when parents are gone  siblings are often the closest family you ve got it d be nice to have that kind of support  i m glad you can find joy in star wars nice  and insanely talented  people are all around this fandom  so it s not a bad place to be 
1912,starwars,much love man i feel you  i m kinda in the same boat my dad has prostate cancer  mum has depression  sister is struggling with school and i have anxiety having something that can just change your mind and take you  man that s real 
1913,starwars,i have none of those problems  but i agree with you on that one op
1914,starwars,i always liked the phase two helmets the most great job  op 
1915,starwars,front page my man 
1916,starwars,the ot stormtrooper helmets are so damn cool 
1917,starwars,republic emblem has <SMILE> spokes 
1918,starwars,its fun to look at certain parts like the eyes or the jawline as they change
1919,starwars,slow it down plox
1920,starwars,by far the best helmet was rex s helmet he was the only one who i ve ever seen with it it s like a combination of phase 1 and phase 2
1921,starwars,stay positive my man  you ll get through this every life has moments that make us who we are  this seems to be yours  may the force be with you
1922,starwars,that is bad ass  good job 
1923,starwars,it bugs me more than it probably should that the first order helmet does nt follow the established trend of the eyes <URL> more distinct 
1924,starwars,good fucking animation man
1925,starwars,is this after effects 
1926,starwars,wait what movies is the second one in  i dont recall seeing it 
1927,starwars,i must have this 
1928,starwars,does nobody else find this to be awkwardly exactly what the general population thinks of the  tech guy  at their work  some nerdy white guy  that at any point may explode and attack somebody over nothing 
1929,starwars,i want it  someone 3d print it 
1930,starwars,yaaassss
1931,starwars,thats great
1932,starwars,i love the design of the first order stormtrooper  but the basic outline reminds me of this   vignette4wikianocookienetyoutubepoopimagesbb<SMILE>quagmire_by_ikapowjpgrevisionlatest  cb  20130210171<SMILE>20
1933,starwars,sweet 
1934,starwars,this is going to get lost but can you please please please make the finn helmet with blood a wallpaper  1920x10<SMILE>0  you d be a god send
1935,starwars,that picture is not made by the deadpool marketing team it s by an artist called bosslogic 
1936,starwars,if this was real  i would totally buy it
1937,starwars,  holds up chimichanga 
1938,starwars,it looked like a tube of carmex in the thumbnail  would have fit too 
1939,starwars,good fucking animation man
1940,starwars,really good animation like  really good  but  i would love to see a data visualization of the storm trooper s evolution of accuracy somewhere in here i think it would really bring the animation full circle
1941,starwars,i d love to get this as a figure irl
1942,starwars,i get this reference
1943,starwars,who is this person  i have a feeling i m missing out on something here 
1944,starwars,okay i m sick if seeing this shit everywhere once again reddit memes a meme into the dirt 
1945,starwars,i like how everyone is holding up a weaponobject in front of their face meanwhile leia has a well placed holo beam of light in front of her 
1946,starwars,jason wingreen his voice work for boba was cooler than morrison s voice work
1947,starwars,no fear in you  i sense much strength you have  much strength 
1948,starwars,sending love people do nt realize how much good star wars does for the fans keep your chin up  it will get better
1949,starwars,rule 2  take a shot for every 100 anonymous clone deaths  that ll empty a bottle in about 5 episodes 
1950,starwars,phase i will always be my favourite 
1951,starwars,have you done any other awesome animations ubiplaneblues 
1952,starwars,punk bitch 
1953,starwars,god dammit  if that were a figurine for sale  i d buy one today today 
1954,starwars,not from tcw but my brother and i were watching the phantom menace and decided to take a drink every time jarjar opened his mouth then we decided every other sentence then we chose to live and did every scene where he has a speaking part
1955,starwars,take a sip any time a droid is destroyed 
1956,starwars,every time  tcw spoilers   s  fives dies   drink until your liver commits suicide 
1957,starwars,towards the end of rots  bail organa landed at the jedi temple and was greeted by 501st troopers  and they were not hostile to him  but when the jedi attacked the clones  they killed him  and then proceeded to fire on organa  why 
1958,starwars,they were just attacked by a jedi  bail yelled before fleeing i think they took it as bail being a jedi sympathiser and overreacted their officer order them immediately to cease fire as he s a senator 
1959,starwars,just finished that i do nt think they were trying to shoot organa i think they were just caught off guard by the jedi did you get the part about when they discover tyranus is dooku  did they not know that tyranus had the clones commissioned  did they not know it was dooku  why did they keep using them once they knew dooku was responsible  did nt really get that   i just watched end of tcw  ep3 so the two got blurred in my head the questions are related to tcw 
1960,starwars,  oh really  you re cold    
1961,starwars,who here is going  cosplay  selling anything  pretty much share your plans for this year s celebration 
1962,starwars,i m definitely going i m from the uk  but live in the us and i go to a lot of comic cons over here i m really excited for london having the event as i ll get to go with my family for once my first celebration was last year  so if it s anything close to that  i ll be very happy 
1963,starwars,i m going all 3 days it ll be first celebration for me i ve actually booked myself into a cheap motel a 30 minute walk from the event 
1964,starwars,first celebration too  i ll be there with my wife and our little one 
1965,starwars,i m going there s four of us  my wife  and our two friends  couple   any suggestions for cosplay  <URL> 
1966,starwars,i live in london now  and did nt know about this  of course  looks like it s sold out what exactly is  preshow   is there any hope to actually get a ticket or will buying them now be insanely marked up
1967,starwars,i m going while on my honeymoon  first time  and we are both crazy excited 
1968,starwars,why do people get upset about the idea of the thermal exhaust port  internal power station  or thermal oscillator  it makes sense that a base that contains so much powerenergy needs a way to control it it s not an a fatal flaw in the empire s weapons design  it s a part of the rationale of the design 
1969,starwars,i have no problem with the thermal oscillator on the starkiller the whole planet was shielded  and poe only got inside the oscillator because han and chewie blew up an opening i d consider it reasonably wellprotected  but maybe it could have used more redundancy 
1970,starwars,the sheer improbability of that weakness being exploited is what makes the rebels  victory  resistance victory in vii  such a triumph  they were able to penetrate and destroy the empire s  ultimate power in the universe  by making the desperate move of taking out the thermal exhaust port
1971,starwars,while i agree with your sentiment  i do nt agree with trying to explain it with rationale i see so many posts below trying to rationalize why it had to be that way  but seriously folks  any engineering degree grad will laugh at the idea that it  had to be that way  or that if it was nt that  than it would be something else yes  there would be something else next on the list of next most vulnerable  but you can engineer it so the next most vulnerable weakness is not so easily exploitable nothing is indestructible  but the ds was nt even close we have modern war machines that have less obvious design flaws than the ds  the real answer is   because it s a damn movie  and   this   should be enough of an explanation to anyone having a beef with the thermal exhaust port 
1972,starwars,it s a design flaw if you can blow up a moonsized space station by dropping a bomb in one hole  it s a flaw and it s literally as easy to solve as putting a grate over it 
1973,starwars,  youtubeagcrwgdkulw
1974,starwars,i love mark the great thing about him  is that he is not just an actor but a great fan  i love that he just embraces all the memes that are going on about luke in tfa he s a genuinely great guy 
1975,starwars, w<SMILE>4<SMILE>
1976,starwars,damn he s fun 
1977,starwars,i m really concerned about how rey and luke are going to break that awkward silence   um hi   i brought your lightsaber   oh well i got a new one so 
1978,starwars,it was released in europe 2 days before it was released in the united states it was available as a lowquality torrent within hours 
1979,starwars,advanced screenings  production leaks  screener copies getting into the wrong hands  etc  most people are pretty civil  but all it takes is one asshole to ruin it for everyone 
1980,starwars,early showings  script leaks  people on the set  deduction from other leaks so we know that this character is in the movie  but they have no more scenes following this one scene that they were ultrasecretive about yup  we know what happened 
1981,starwars,my job puts me in contact with more than a few superfans the unquenchable thirst to be the one that  knows  what happened combined with troll culture creates people who love to ruin the big twist no matter if it was unforeseen or obvious as day it s pretty hard to ignore the internet these days 
1982,starwars,people guessing and just happen to be right postmovie 
1983,starwars,before the movie even was released i had the movie s biggest death scene spoiled for me by my fucktard brother  and he had read it somewhere online  facebook   my question is  how are things like this spoiled before the movie is even released 
1984,starwars,any time someone fallscrashes and would normally be dead in real life  take a shot 
1985,starwars,i value my liver dude
1986,starwars,every time  tcw spoilers   s  fives dies   drink until your liver commits suicide 
1987,starwars,take a shot any time anakin gets electrocuted 
1988,starwars,take a drink any time a jedi dies and everybody acts all sad  but nobody cares when a clone dies 
1989,starwars,take a sip any time a droid is destroyed 
1990,starwars,rule 2  take a shot for every 100 anonymous clone deaths  that ll empty a bottle in about 5 episodes 
1991,starwars,oo  another one take a drink whenever someone gets lightsabered through the chest 
1992,starwars,drink any time a blaster is fired at a jedi and the shot misses 
1993,starwars,not from tcw but my brother and i were watching the phantom menace and decided to take a drink every time jarjar opened his mouth then we decided every other sentence then we chose to live and did every scene where he has a speaking part
1994,starwars,i m there for the full three days  i do nt know anyone going 
1995,starwars,i meant to save all my kotor art to post together when i finish but it  s taken too long and i got bored so here  s my reimagining of juhani it  s been on the backburner while i work on other work stuff like commissions and the rest of the kotor crew previous research indicated that she  s wellhated  and i think her design was not very good  so i decided to reign in some of the more extreme decisions made by the bioware team i think she had a lot of cool potential  so i tried to make her less of a weird furry and more of a bad bitch  specs  i painted this entirely in 2d in photoshop on a cintiq tablet final file is 9k px tall and 44gb preexport hundreds of layers  i don  t feel like counting yes  that means it  s  not a real painting   it  s a digital painting it probably took over a hundred hours  though i don  t count anymore my brushes are from many sources including the most popular and famous brushsets out there  such as jaime jones   maciej kuciara  s  shaddy safadi  s  and plenty of custom ones i have a little folder of like twenty favourite brushes that i do 95  of my painting with  please hit me with any questions or input you have  thanks for looking 
1996,starwars,nice  goes along with that godlike bastila of yours   i never understood people s hate towards juhani though  she s an amazing character  disturbed yet refined  and redeemed in the end  looking forward to the rest of the crew  keep up the good work 
1997,starwars,i love that extralong saber hilt it s cool  very guardianesque for her to basically have a  bastard sword  saber the whole ensemble is pretty badass  i always liked juhani as a character  but she was pretty weirdlooking in kotor they made the cathar look a lot better in swtor 
1998,starwars,this character has always amused me so much juhani is a male name in finland 
1999,starwars,looks awesome op 
2000,leagueoflegends,just use pings do nt type to people  do nt use chat i ve never been a rager  but it seems you may just have some self control issues if you have a problem not saying anything  also  anything you say is probably not going to be followed and all you re doing is making the game worse for everyone you re playing with you are literally making the game harder to win by flaming people that make mistakes do yourself a favor and just let mistakes go  there is a 100  chance that you also make plenty of mistakes  everyone does  so them making a mistake is not that big of a deal 
2001,leagueoflegends,hey guys  i m a flamer and i m one of those guys who make league shitty and  famous  for their bad community i tried so many things already to prevent insulting my teammates because they did something wrong  or even i did something wrong does any of you feel the same and know a solution how to get a non toxic player 
2002,leagueoflegends,one thing that helped me was any one of the plethora of videos out there that point out how futile it is to flame people  it does nt make my teammates feel good  it does nt make me feel good because i still got the loss  and it does nt help me win there is literally no benefit to raging at people 
2003,leagueoflegends,shout at the screen and do nt type you end up venting but your teammates do nt even know you re raging 
2004,leagueoflegends,hire a elo booste and boost your accountonce you get to higher rank and play with people much better than you  you will know how garbage your are 
2005,leagueoflegends,you cant  its who you are you tend to be get angry real easily just like me  yes you can control yourself a bit but in the end you have to flame or you ll lose your shit
2006,leagueoflegends,if you put  first and you type what you say no one will see it sometimes it helps me release steam without hurting poor little malphites feelings
2007,leagueoflegends,which artworks did you count  i feel like there are way more than these  for example  your list does nt have gangplank but he was in  this picture     <URL>  story1  together with graves  you also did nt count the following artworks made by riot    <URL>  no vi    <URL>  no lux  not sure if you have counted these two    <URL>   <URL>
2008,leagueoflegends,xpeke for sure
2009,leagueoflegends,ashe was the first champ i saw in ads on websites also bought a headset with a code for a free ashe skin and 2win ip boost did nt play yet  gave the code to a friend tt
2010,leagueoflegends,good thing we killed ryze last patch so he does nt need any promos anymore 
2011,leagueoflegends,i believe teemo would be the most famously identified league character 
2012,leagueoflegends,i approve 
2013,leagueoflegends,so  i was bored af and so i decided to find out who was statistically the most recognizable face in lol i <URL> by going through every single official piece of artwork from riot games that  1 had more than two champions featured 2 was not promoting a skin line i had gone through eleven pictures of this type and tallied up points for each champion when they were featured in the art work  with each appearance equaling  1  point after that  i had gone through every cinematic officially produced by riot games that  1 was not directly tied to lore  that includes journal of justice  2 was produced under the exact name  league of legends  champions featured in a cinematic who were not a  skin  version of themselves  sorry  demonblade tryndamere  got  3  points while champions who got their own music video got  5  points  because i feel like it alright  and now for the results in 3rd  2nd  1st place ordering    11th place     all the peasants who got no points  move on please  artwork appearances  0cinematic appearances  0   total points  0     10th place     what game is this from   akali  braum  caitlyn  dr mundo  lee sin  olaf  orianna  riven  shaco  shen  shyvana  tristana  ziggs artwork appearances  1cinematic appearances  0   total points  1     9th place     oh yeah  the cougar lady  crocodile  and robot   blitzcrank  nidalee  renekton artwork appearances  2cinematic appearances  0   total points  2     <SMILE>th place     the what s their name again  s  cassiopea  draven  irelia  jax  nasus  nautilus  rengar  swain  twisted fate artwork appearances  0cinematic appearances  1   total points  3   ezreal artwork appearances  3cinematic appearances  0   total points  3     7th place     the recognizables  darius  leona  malphite  master yi  morgana artwork appearances  1cinematic appearances  1   total points  4     6th place     the b  team  ashe  chogath  garen  graves  miss fortune  warwick artwork appearances  2cinematic appearances  1   total points  5   jinx artwork appearances  0music video appearances  1   total points  5     5th place     the star players  ahri  alistar  fiddlesticks  jarvan  kayle  mordekaiser artwork appearances  3cinematic appearances  1   total points  6   amumu artwork appearances  1music video appearances  1   total points  6     4th place     the cuteness factor of league of legends  annie  teemo artwork appearances  4cinematic appearances  1   total points  7     3rd place     the secret lover of riot games  nocturne artwork appearances  6cinematic appearances  1   total points  9   quite a surprise to me  someone at riot really must have a soft spot for the guy    2nd place     the duke of league of legends  ryze artwork appearances  4cinematic appearances  3   total points  13   for someone so heavily featured in advertising  he has the be the biggest problem child league has ever had balancing wise    1st place     the queen of league of legends  katarina artwork appearances  6cinematic appearances  3   total points  15   this could be for multiple reasons  but i think it comes down to having a very cool and very attractive design  well there it is  too much work for too little reward  but it s fine if you would like links to all artworks and videos i used as sources  i can provide katarina is the poster child of league of legends  i do nt think anyone was that surprised  edit  alright  i come back home and i see 50 new replies and 200 upvotes  thanks guys   i ve received a lot of criticism on what i could ve better implemented and i ve thought on it i ve decided to make a revamped list so please comment things i should factor in the list i originally posted was from the perspective of a player with little to no knowledge of lol  this next one will be much more indepth on who is featured the most for both casuals and hardcore fans to find who truly is the face of league of legends  please give suggestions 
2014,leagueoflegends,funnily enough there s a space at my local game store which the riot points cards are found this spot uses a pic of jinx to advertise the game  since jinx is nt on this list  i d have no idea how well she d sell the game 
2015,leagueoflegends,would nt ziggs have a lot more points for all the summoner icons that he s in like doombots hexakill etc
2016,leagueoflegends,gt  3rd place   the secret lover of riot games  nocturne artwork appearances  6cinematic appearances  1total points  9 quite a surprise to me  someone at riot really must have a soft spot for the guy  well i mean  he s basically the coolest champion in the league  so 
2017,leagueoflegends,before i got into lol  which is last spring  the only champs i knew by name were teemo  annie  ahri  jinx  and ezreal 
2018,leagueoflegends,where s ekko  i mean he got his own cinematic and a small graphic novel  should nt he be mentioned somewhere in the rankings 
2019,leagueoflegends,i knew before reading it d be katarina the whole character just looks fantastic  simple  yet elegant design looks fantastic and chicks with knives are just ye 
2020,leagueoflegends,i do nt know if there was a bug with your post  or one riot just forgot about but 
2021,leagueoflegends,i feel like for people who are in the loop of lol then lee sin  ahri  zed  teemo  ryze  annie and kat are probably the front runners  some part of me thinks blitz too  but he has kinda been a no show for a while now 
2022,leagueoflegends, sometimes you can go through hard times in life  sometimes you just need some relief from everyday life  and this game brings just that  queuing up with 4 random other people  <URL> a team for 30 mins where you feel important and your biggest worry is the udyr splitpushing or when the next baron is coming up no matter who you are  what situation you are in  you can give it up to <URL> a champion alongside your teammates and feel important  feel powerful  and feel the achievement you sometimes cant in the real world  this game has helped me a tonne get over some hard times  and the same for many others  and i hope it continues long into the future see you on the rift 
2023,leagueoflegends,i would say dr mundo in the apple release would count but up to you if voice and fist counts
2024,leagueoflegends,of all time  ryze  katarina  and nocturne  more recently  vi  jinx  ahri  and darius 
2025,leagueoflegends,leally 
2026,leagueoflegends,he just went to get a hair cut ___
2027,leagueoflegends,that is one type of comment that i was expecting to encounter more in this subreddit i am tired of crying and asking to have a better league instead of appreciating how good league really is  this is a free game  an awesome free game  i am playing for so long this game  <URL> awfull at it each day that goes by but i enjoy it each day even more  is that thing that  even when your day was a sh  tty one you can always expect excitement and awesomeness on the rift  i mean  when the euw is up or else it is gon na be a depressing day alright  but even so it is free  
2028,leagueoflegends,seriously i work seven days a week from eight to eight i do nt take a lot from my check since i m working to help all i ask is a decent computer and league it s enough to get me through the day and i m content besides final fantasy  nothing newer than 12  there s no other game that makes me feel <URL>  no matter how sad that sounds 
2029,leagueoflegends,my best friend recently passed away i was mentally so depressed that i just did nt want to do anything anything besides league he and i loved league it connected us two even more than we already were even though i could nt play with him anymore i had created friends through him that bonded with each other through league it made me happy to be around  these people and have fun in league it s beautiful how a game can bring so much joy to a person it s life and how it can even help a mourning process 
2030,leagueoflegends,that s every video game though i mean that s the darn beauty of it being able to escape and shift your worries to dragons n shit tbh if you use a universe as an escape there are far better ones than league but i see your point  
2031,leagueoflegends,i to love league  i just hate the fact that i m absolute garbage at the game 
2032,leagueoflegends,and shit talk like a boss
2033,leagueoflegends,finaly   i hope he will do well in this week 
2034,leagueoflegends,refugees crisis has hit esports  
2035,leagueoflegends,with ryu back in the mid lane i think h2k will clearly be the best team in the league  looking forward to seeing him play again
2036,leagueoflegends,next week  rock lee taking off his weights
2037,leagueoflegends,that awkward moment when ryus most famous moment is getting outplayed by faker   <URL>  v  zpcfocvcx3u
2038,leagueoflegends,actually he is playing in a 5 man dynamicq with gilius  eika and visi wwwtwitchtvgodgilius

2041,leagueoflegends,_ does this look like a face of mercy 
2042,leagueoflegends,looks like h2k has a shot at iem now o wait 
2043,leagueoflegends,ryu back fantasy points distributed between the carries more evenly instead of having selfie hug all of it yay  too bad h2k s games might have less skirmishes as a result of cleaner midlate games 
2044,leagueoflegends,what is this  an fps  losing by one shot because you have to reload such tilt 
2045,leagueoflegends,do nt reload 
2046,leagueoflegends,shit talk bernie and this is what happens  feelthebern
2047,leagueoflegends,i really think jhin s 4th shot should do bonus damage to structures  like ziggs  passive 
2048,leagueoflegends,the reload was nt even the biggest problem  he fucked up the last auto before that 
2049,leagueoflegends,c9 vs ssb game 4 
2050,leagueoflegends,this reminds me of a certain worlds game they played against ssb 
2051,leagueoflegends,must be nice to have a 25 sec reload trough the whole game
2052,leagueoflegends,lol i was that kayle  i stopped auto attacking cause i thought they clearly won too t i l t 
2053,leagueoflegends,i love how he laughs it off  if this was me in silver 4 promos my pc would be broken
2054,leagueoflegends,was watching this live last night and holy shit it was funny  the commentary while waiting after game is worth watching toohaha 
2055,leagueoflegends,i wonder if graves was reloading as well  the ultimate double reloading tilt 
2056,leagueoflegends,i do nt get why people are so upset about this regi only ever makes changes he thinks are going to improve the team idk i just trust that regi thought the team needed a different coach 
2057,leagueoflegends, what the format should be based on     wikiteamliquidnetdota2the_international2015 
2058,leagueoflegends,eww mainland china nope no thanks  hong kong maybe 
2059,leagueoflegends,i went to msi last year  and it was my first league event ever since it was so close to where i live  and it was so insanely hype i saw all the casters  lilypichu  locodoco walked right past me and someone asked him for a picture and he said no lol i was fanboying so hard over all the players and coaches and casters and personalities and it was just so fun whoever needs convincing to go to a league event in na  try to go to worlds this year  you wo nt regret it 
2060,leagueoflegends,does this mean worlds is going to be in na  canada  or maybe a wild card region 
2061,leagueoflegends,love that video  also appreciate the double round robin change   
2062,leagueoflegends,i think it s a bit sad na is hosting worlds for the third time  while china is still left with minor events   edit  comeon guys  msi is nowhere near the level of worlds  its six teams fighting for a few days  worlds lasts a fucking month and has 16 teams  edit2  and even changes cities through stages 
2063,leagueoflegends,good stuff  both on the location  and on the expanded group stage  nice 
2064,leagueoflegends,sixteam tournament again  lol fans really do get shafted considering how many awesome tournaments other esports titles get  riot is known for moving at a snails  pace but i expected atleast <SMILE> teams  edit  valve is also hosting their dota 2 major in shanghai and 16 teams participate in that event with superior gsl group stage format  double elimination playoff brackets not to mention   3 million in prize pool  no crowdfunding  step your game up rito 
2065,leagueoflegends,  rip    all the western people will suffocate badly from breathing in the air pollution 
2066,leagueoflegends,i am extremely thankful for the opportunity that tsm gave me i came into this position not knowing what to expect  and in the end i learned a lot about myself that will help me improve in all facets of my life i have never worked with a more driven group of players who are willing to do anything to be the best their only path is upwards i wish them all the best in the future and will be rooting for them throughout their careers and life even though i did my best on a daily basis  i apologize for letting the players  organization  and the fans down 
2067,leagueoflegends,it s not his fault  coming from a sports background  he can not truly connect with the players and understand how they feel i m not sure if he played the game or not but to understand a gamer  he would need to play the game and feel the same frustration the players are feeling in episode 4  he failed to see how frustrated the team was with winning against a team with 3 subs  and when he said  can they smile    i guess that pissed off the players to have a coach who do nt understand them how do you coach a team when you do nt know how they think or feel 
2068,leagueoflegends,seems like they re saying kc s lack of game knowledge was too much of a barrier to <URL> i wondered if this would be the case sure seems like it would be hard for him to be able to relate to the players and give them advice on a meaningful level if they know he s out of his element compare it to how they received weldon s advice  knowing he has a league background i imagine they ll bring in someone with more familiarity with league as a replacement  although i thought they might just decide jarge would be capable of serving as head coach i guess they want to split up the duties so he can solely focus on ingame strategy  in any case  both sides are being super professional about this  which is good to see 
2069,leagueoflegends,i can not imagine the salt if lpl does not at least make finals  let alone win the whole event again 
2070,leagueoflegends, after last year  s msi  we wanted to see more region vs region matches  so we  ve decided to expand the group stage on may 4<SMILE> to a double roundrobin format  meaning twice as many games  yesyesyes  love that change 
2071,leagueoflegends,most interesting part is the part about several candidates  i kind of assumed it would just be jarge in charge of coaching the team 
2072,leagueoflegends,china  baron  baron  
2073,leagueoflegends,if tsm is looking for someone to fire by the end of the split or next week i am available i just need someone to pay for my plane tickets
2074,leagueoflegends,off the cuff  honestly  you have to be stern with these players i remember when i played footballtrack  if anyone looked away or looked like they were nt paying attention  no matter how tired or out of breath  the coach chewed you out and punished you with more sprints  backpedals  and etc  if bjerg or anyone on the team gives any attitude  fk them a coach  especially a head coach  should never allow players to give them shit  ever i m sick of all this na  culture  bs athletes respect their damn coaches in traditional sports  when orgs put their players before the head coach  or undermine the head coachreferencing blattthere s a problem this is a consistent problem with tsm it does nt really matter what tsm shows or does nt show on tsm legends the fact that he even answered kc back at all is a problem hell  bjerg even admitted he did nt get along with loco  and that lack of respect undermined loco s authority with the whole team the best players in their role in their region  need to respect their damn coaches kc also failed to command respect  and honestly  he probably could have done more we do nt really know how much authority regi assigned to kc  but his philosophy of  players get a say  is bullshit  i was a tsm fan from way back in the daybut their philosophy and their lack of results are pathetic this is so stupid it s obvious  and it always has been  but i m sick of this team always winning na and doing nothing with it their farthest run was a kr team messing around lvl 1 and getting snowballed on  ssw s4 worlds   if regi does nt change his philosophy and allow any head coach to shut down any player that either talks back or disrespects the head coach  the team will always be nothing  i ll compare it to hs football they may always with their district against shit teams with no talent  but as soon as they play the inner city kids with talent  they get crushed every time    edit    i ll add some more my hs volleyball coach demanded perfection he demanded winning sloppy wins got the team bleacher suicides at 10 pm at night after playing an exhausting game our football team winning districts  had our coach flipping tables at half time because we were only up by 6 points against a shit team  despite doing well the whole season leading up to that game   some of our players went to d1 schools and ended up in the nfl the volleyball coach won a state title  and was runner up for the state title the next 3 years in a row a head coach does nt give a shit if players like him  a real head coach does nt put up with back talk or players who do nt give their undivided attention everything else is for the assistant coach  who  if she s any good  will make sure respect is given 
2075,leagueoflegends,thorin is gon na rake in that hardcore tsm skrilla 
2076,leagueoflegends,see i do nt think tsm is bad they have said the whole season we will be top 2 by playoffs you look at their games this season and yes you can say they have got lucky in some games but no team in na at the moment other than immortals has taken advantage of their weak  start 
2077,leagueoflegends,thooorin really managed to hit the nail on the head here while he has questionable knowledge about some of the inner workings of the game  he is very good at extrapolating and referencing his points in making a strong argument  kc was never shown having a strong impact on the players and yes  while we base that on the legends series  why is it after 4 episodes we see nothing of positive consequence when he speaks  while it is not defining of how effective he is as a coach to tsm  it does give a hint towards a certain idea  i think what people fail to recognize is that the current iteration of tsm is not like any of the previous iterations of tsm  which thooorin mentions i think kc would have been a pretty good head coach for tsm of season 5  but he lacks the ability to control as many large voices as currently exist in tsm season 6  also that ending alphadraft plug was gold 
2078,leagueoflegends,i m still not entirely sure why this guy is relevant is it the same reason certain shock jocks keep getting jobs at different radio stations after the continually get fired for crossing the line  i mean  his entire schtick is just bagging on everything he can lol
2079,leagueoflegends,what the actual fuck is wrong with you thorin  do you live in a polarstation  are you going somewhere in a hurry after the video  why in the name of all that is satan do you got eleven jackets  fourteen hoodies and a scarf 
2080,leagueoflegends,totally agree with the playerbyplayer analysis  especially with dl talking too much about strategy  when i dont see him being that good at that  and bjerg dont following ys s shotcalling 
2081,leagueoflegends,i stopped being able to listen when he was using tsm legends as evidence  up until then he was really on point and i do nt mean to trash the video  but come on it s a reality show  it s not reality the bits they re showing us might as well be the players putting on skits in between their real work like  i like reality shows  but you have to take them for what they are  edit  for people who are unclear on what i mean  let me expand in a reality show  you can prompt people into an artificial situation  ie   kc  give a speech to the team so that we can get that on film   and ask them to respond naturally and even though you re asking them to respond naturally  it does nt mean they will continuing that previous example  maybe kc never gives speeches or even if he does  knowing he s preparing it for legends will change how he delivers it the reactions of everyone else are similarly affected maybe they d normally be jumping in and having a discussion  but because this is  kc s speech time for the camera   they let him talk  maybe bjergsen is asked  bjergsen  how do you feel about this   and sometime when he d normally just sit on his opinion  he expresses it and he comes off as a diva  or maybe he is  but we  do nt know    by prompting someone to do something or say something  even if you ask them to do it naturally  you still can get a contrived situation   everyone  greet svenskeren as he comes in  gives you porn level acting   also  reality shows are trying to tell a cohesive story and editing can severely affect how people look usually audiences will underestimate this  but the affect can be really huge if you want  you can edit basically anyone to look any way you want  as long as they ve ever acted this way someone s the nicest person ever except when they re starving  and they were starving twice this week  i can make it look like they re being nasty to their teammates continually or i can make it look like they re the nicest person ever the truth is somewhere in between  on that vein  if kc s been a not perfect  but pretty good coach  and i m not assuming that  but just for example   i can make him look like the best coach ever or the worst  depending on how that fits my story now  tsm legends is nt looking to vilify the players or staff  so they are nt going to make him look like the worst worst  but in trying to tell a very condensed version of the story  some extreme simplifying is going to happen anyway  because there are only 30ish minutes per episode  and a lot of that time is earmarked for game time  player confessionals  team post game analysis  etc   and you can end up thinking  and this is an example to illustrate my point  not actually what people think   wow  kc is lethargic and unenergetic all the time   when the reality could be  continuing that example  that kc is tired in the mornings 
2082,leagueoflegends,thorin s honestly right about yellowstar  he s not a great laning support  but an amazing team shot caller and captain for regi to say  after bringing in yellowstar himself  that he does nt want one main shot caller for the team is insane that just diminishes yellowstars worth to the team almost entirely honestly  if kasing had stay d with tsm i believe they would nt have started so poorly  and in my prediction i believe yellowstar will leave tsm or they will continue to fail internationally 
2083,leagueoflegends,thoorin is pretty much spot on  tsm have probably the best midlander in the nalcs  one of the best adcs in the nalcs  and yellowstar a very good to support and very good captainshotcaller they should think we re gon na work hard  we re gon na work together  and we re gon na fuck up the whole league thoorin is also spot on that there is a difference between channeling ego in positive and negative ways  the thing that i see is that tsm are not utilizing the pieces they have to their maximum effect yellowstar not shotcalling and not captaining is like having hai and not letting him do his thing also  while the macro synergy is getting better  it s still not there  tsm  right now  is like having a swiss army knife and just using one tool  the reason teams work is because people know  understand  and execute their roles tsm do nt really know or understand their roles  and because of that  they ca nt execute those roles  will this fix itself  if they find a good coach that can get everyone on the same page  or the team can solve their problems themselves  then yes saying you re not on the same page is step 1  but there s about 10 steps after that that are more important  including being able to speak frankly to each other without feeling being hurt about whats been going wrong and how to fix it  giving people a clear framework of what they want to do  how they re going to do it  and what everyone s roles in that are  this is ingame stuff  these are the things i see  edit  it s also pretty hilarious that some of you seem to think he wears a coat in all of his video  when if you d watched the video to the end  you ll see thumbnails of some more of his videos  and most of them he s not wearing a coat however  do nt let facts get in the way of your memes  reddit we would nt want that  would we   
2084,leagueoflegends,these where added on the pbe a long time ago  but never hooked up to the smart ping system    wwwsurrenderat20net201407730pbeupdatehtml not sure if they ever will be ingame would be nice though 
2085,leagueoflegends,danger and warning are kind of redundant so they could just replace one of those
2086,leagueoflegends,i mean look at skt zyra  you look like a hulking behemoth plant so ugly and no particles  missed a great opportunity at some cable plants 
2087,leagueoflegends,is nt flaming and raging part of online gaming  that s how people behave online i love it when people come up with some original and interesting insult the true toxic players are those who go afk after being killed two or three times  or feed on purpose i would rather have a teammate that flames a lot but know how to play the damn game at the same time 
2088,leagueoflegends,you could also just press v to signal yellow ping and type  warded  instead of  there s a ward here 
2089,leagueoflegends,epic
2090,leagueoflegends,the biggest problem league has ever had balancing was kassadin 
2091,leagueoflegends,im surprised lux wasnt on this list  i thought she was on the team builder artwork 
2092,leagueoflegends,well with the exception of nocturne  who has been around for a few years himself   the top 5 have all been in the game for so long that it s not surprising they are the highest
2093,leagueoflegends,ryze  katarina  alistar
2094,leagueoflegends,holy fuck that would put me on tilt for the rest of my life
2095,leagueoflegends,  <URL> kind of along these lines for lol  this guy actually turned in to a basement dweller but gave him a sense of worth which brought him back good story for sure 
2096,leagueoflegends,i do nt know why but sometimes i have those games in which people flame even before you select your champion instead of farming they tell you in great detail how much you suck there are days when i got those games 3 times in a row and it makes me consider giving up on ranked enterily 
2097,leagueoflegends,then someone feeds so its not my fault and i got ta do another game  then someone trolls and its still not my fault and i got ta do yet another game  then someone in the enemy team dcs and its not a challenge so i got ta do one last game  then i do that one last game  win and its all cool  bbbbaaaaaaaackkkkkk to the real world and my worries just got bigger coz im a few hours short 
2098,leagueoflegends,ryu is back and zed buffs oh this is going to be fun

2104,leagueoflegends,unlucky number 4 
2105,leagueoflegends,i would have to call it quits for the night after this 
2106,leagueoflegends,rip kc 20152016
2107,leagueoflegends,poor jihn reloads
2108,leagueoflegends,there were some funny but true statements in there but why on earth is this guy sitting in a room fully clothed scratching his hair all the time  does he have no heating system or did nt he pay the bills  anyway  that s some awkward approach to bring in critics about other people  
2109,leagueoflegends,because its bigger
2110,leagueoflegends,what if this was the imt vs c9 game ending lmaoo 
2111,leagueoflegends,no one saying alistar  that surprises me 
2112,leagueoflegends,could be useful in order to expand quick communication in solo queue 
2113,leagueoflegends,heimer
2114,leagueoflegends,sometimes i need to look at the champs i have to see who to play maybe clicking an arrow or something bringing the champ selection screen would be good 
2115,leagueoflegends,sona because i m a simple man 
2116,leagueoflegends,personally  i bought cassiopeia  just because of that epic ultimate and her splash art was so cool  3
2117,leagueoflegends,ipalistar rpzac
2118,leagueoflegends,lux
2119,leagueoflegends,did clg really just move up a tier after getting dicked on by tsm and doing okay vs nrg  why did jin air drop 
2120,leagueoflegends,definitely disagree with echo fox being d tier while impulse is c tier i feel like the writer went strictly off standings instead of considering the fact that ef s main roster actually has a respectable record and did nt look half bad this weekend either this is nt to say impulse should nt be c tier  that s a completely different discussion but echo fox should nt be a tier below them 
2121,leagueoflegends,would lee have hit ryze anyway  xd i know ryze was moving downward but i can never tell with hitboxes these days bad luck on no assist hehe
2122,leagueoflegends,  playstvvideo56c3cc35052c3d3a34  20 seconds  i wish i got an assist lol edit  youtube mirror    <URL>  v  ieacsi3pg2gamp  feature  youtube
2123,leagueoflegends,it s interesting to see those power ranking evolve trough each weeks but remember that once playoffs time is coming and game start to be bo3  strategy  diversity and adaptation will be more and more valuable quality that team will need to bring  i definitely enjoyed the past week beetween the big eu clash games and c9 vs imt but on 63 this week  gragas buff  corki nerf  graves nerf  kogmaw buff  xin buff  rework  ryze ultra nerf   new 24th dragon  man the meta will shake 
2124,leagueoflegends,i know they were controversial but i miss the international ranking 
2125,leagueoflegends,are these proofread  origin   origen the mistake is in the same paragraph too 
2126,leagueoflegends,people complaining about jin air dropping obviously have nt watched lck since they do nt know that their games are so painfully drawn out even for lck standards
2127,leagueoflegends,lmfao kt above jinair in the standings hilarious
2128,leagueoflegends,that echo fox record does nt really properly correlate to their  seeing how they ve only lost when they had subs i think they can compete tl and nrg 
2129,leagueoflegends,200 iq bug 
2130,leagueoflegends,sneaky cosplay as pobelter 
2131,leagueoflegends,likely cause  because of syndra s displacement giving temporary invulnerability to the minion  it is likely that the reactivation of syndra w opened a window where the minion could be killed  thus the q activation on the minion immediately after   canceling the tp  similar to how killing a turret will cancel a tp 
2132,leagueoflegends,that feel when your friend who lives in the same city has 110 of your download speed but his ping is far better 
2133,leagueoflegends,not sure if it s just me  but half the radial buttons for the ping question dissapear as soon as i select my download speed i can still click them because the cursor still changes  but it s a bit weird 
2134,leagueoflegends,only because you re running the fnc flair 
2135,leagueoflegends,if so he is nt the problem 
2136,leagueoflegends,i think the problems threatening the future of league of legends esports scene go deeper than just riot s balance design philosophies  to name a few other things  riot s own game design philosophy as it relates to individual skill is illconducive to a budding esports scene  most egregious example in this regard is the lack of a training mode  sandbox mode as it s been dubbed  and the stated reasoning for that i call this the worst example because they outright endorse an ineffective means of improving as the preferred method to a lesser extent  lack of replays is another example that s often cited being because of technical issues but they ve had years to work through those issues and it this point it s obvious it is nt a priority both sandbox and replays as well as the design philosophies needed to make them a reality would far better facilitate the growth of the esports scene than the current atmosphere they ve fostered  another problem is lol esports  at least in na  is the risk adverse playstyle amongst the teams it s not exciting to watch two teams attempt to wait each other out  to wait for the earliest mistake and end the game on that i m not entirely convinced these players realize their job is to entertain people  unless they do there s not much of a future for league of legends in the esports scene 
2137,leagueoflegends,  <URL>
2138,leagueoflegends,wow you can hear the crowd and commentators so clearly that must be so annoying for the players 
2139,leagueoflegends,vayne  am i doin it right  
2140,leagueoflegends,the life of poblo lol
2141,leagueoflegends,thanks  i was alt tabed 10 seconds ago and missed it 
2142,leagueoflegends,this is a funny quirk of the interaction  the tp and w basically happened at once  which caused the tp to freak out and go on cooldown this only happens if you re really close enough in server ticks  if syndra w s a minion that is already through the tp animation  05 seconds or more   the person will land normally her w does nt actually interfere with tp normally  it will even remove the visual  but the tper will still land it s actually bad to do this because it will make your team think the tp cancelled when it did nt 
2143,leagueoflegends,filled it goodluck with your assignment
2144,leagueoflegends,great survey  you should do an aftermath post 
2145,leagueoflegends,hello people from reddit  i m a summoner from league of legend and i m asking for your help to do this survey  its a personalschool project  i would like to see is there positivenegative impact while playing league of legend   <URL> lt  here s the link if you are interested
2146,leagueoflegends,great survey  best of luck on the project 
2147,leagueoflegends,something something estalking
2148,leagueoflegends,we are actively tracking the issue no eta yet but it is on the radar 
2149,leagueoflegends,so much clenching going on
2150,leagueoflegends,jax
2151,leagueoflegends,looks good 
2152,leagueoflegends,actually one of the reasons i like it so much 
2153,leagueoflegends,his model is ridiculously big compared to the normal jhin skin  i thought riot went and fixed model sizes for the more ridiculous ones a few months ago and then they release this 
2154,leagueoflegends,i always wondered who this is  is this someone who works for riot or computer made voice  i ca nt find it on the internet  
2155,leagueoflegends,stop playing league of legends 
2156,leagueoflegends,because everything s bigger in texas  obviously 
2157,leagueoflegends,soraka  always loved her forever and always
2158,leagueoflegends,fuck your happiness 
2159,leagueoflegends,well  hope ezreal is not gon na get nerfed too much 
2160,leagueoflegends,dude when is ssw talon coming back  about to start playing him and it s the coolest skin 
2161,leagueoflegends,there was a game called avalon heroes oh how i miss it  
2162,leagueoflegends,started with league tried to get into dota a few times  but the million item actives  i hate active items in league and prefer only to have one or two  and the overall feel of the game turned me off it felt less like i was controlling a member of a team and more like a single unit in a complex game of chess  if that makes sense 
2163,leagueoflegends,i played lots of different versions of dota before i played league my lan group acquired our wc3 copies though unconventional means so we could nt use the online feature i searched for f2p online games similar to dota and found league 
2164,leagueoflegends,been playing league since november 2010  i took a break from it last summer and tried other mobas  dota  biggest issue was the difference in mechanics  everything felt noticeably slower because of the turning caused a sense of being disjointed from what was happening on screen  hots  the lack of items killed it for me  did like the emphasis on objective based gameplay but not enough to keep me around  did nt even bother with the others because i went back to league not long after trying dota and hots  i do nt even particularly love league as a whole as much as i like how much more fluid and responsive it feels relative to its competitors 
2165,leagueoflegends,i ve played just about every other moba i ve come across  including the shortlived infinite crisis and dawngate  rip  
2166,leagueoflegends,everyone forgot lms again lol top  ziv  arguably the best nonkorean toplaner in the world  ca nt wait to see this guy again at msi if ahq makes it  jungle  karsa  karsa is still such a wildcard as he has both good games and bad games  but his full potential is definitely better than mountain s  mid  chawymaple  hard to say for this because ahq is a better team across the board where as maple can still solo carry if needed westdoor still has the same style despite showing a little better champ pool and i m almost certain if ahq makes it to msi  chawy would be the better choice internationally  adc  an  the best adc in lms imo and definitely a top 10 worldwide  support  swordartalbisolleh  this is the hardest category as all 3 have their own strengths and weaknesses  but by the time playoffs comes around i ll be interested to see who comes out on top  i ll do one for lpl anyways  top  koro1flandre  koro is getting back to form and the meta suits him a lot better nowadays and flandre is still a top carry looper gets a honorary mention but i feel like he really needs mata to shine  jungle  clearloveswift  it s definitely between these 2 jungle beasts for best jungler in lpl cl plays more around his team and is more sacrificial in his playstyle swift is right now one of the best carry junglers in the world however  he requires a lot of resources and peel so it ll be interesting to see qg at iem  mid  rookiedoinb  i ca nt believe i m not including pawn but to me he is honestly just plug and fill and though he s not the best  he plays his role well in edg but on pure skill it ll have to be rookie as the best lpl mid laner mechanically why doinb  because he s actually much better than most people give him credit for and he brings so much versatility and flexibility to qg that i do nt think any other midlaner bar faker would bring he can actually hold his lane and when it comes to teamfights  his power levels increase tremendously  adc  pecodeft  i m not sold on wuxx and think he ll be a liability if he does not reign in his sometimes too aggressive nature every other adc is slumping  just decent  or not having enough playtime eg uzi  support  meikomatamor  the 3 m s meiko when he is on point is a top 5 support in the world  especially on engage champions mata is not quite at s4 levels but his vision game and communication with looper is what is keeping rng at the top of group b for now mor has to do so much peeling for swift and v that he is underrated because he does nt shine as much back in na lcs he died the most but also was vital to lmq s playstyle now on a resurgent qg he has better teammates and his skill level also increased and he s definitely a beast support 
2167,leagueoflegends,agree with them for the most part except for wildturtle  probably someone like freeze

2174,leagueoflegends,2 face 4 me
2175,leagueoflegends,say it out loud rather than type  what i normally do is  wtf was that  out loud or  how the fuck did you miss that smite  then type  its ok  we ll get the next one 
2176,leagueoflegends,holy shit dude that s pretty sweet 
2177,leagueoflegends,look up how to disable enter with autohotkey it disables enter while league of legends is the active window  while youre in a game   i used to use it but took it off after i stopped getting angryannoyed at the game you also have to realize that you wo nt change the game by raging  you win some you lose some

2196,leagueoflegends,ive tried hon back in 2012  but i could nt play with those graphics because i was used to the better lol graphics  when dawngate came out i played it a lot and i loved it  sucks that it has been cancelled  there was another small moba game i remember playing for about 2 weeks  but that one complete dissapeared  i ve downloaded smite when it came out  got a beta key from a friend   but have nt played it for more than 5 hours i think  i ve also tried a moba that i found on steam  called sins of a dark age i like the medieval feeling of the game  but the abilities did nt react fast enough for me  it was still a new game   so i stopped playing it i might try it again sometime later  never played dota or hots  might try it out sometime but i doubt it

2201,leagueoflegends,op s post history 
2202,leagueoflegends,i guess if we are being technical  i did play one game of the original dota before league  otherwise  i have tried smite and got bored of it extremely fast their choice of camera angle really put me off and i dropped it after a couple of hours of play  i tried dota 2 multiple times  but i dislike it for multiple reasons every time  extremely confusing interface  general feel of clunkyness and slow movement because of turn rate  yes  i know why it is there  thank you very much   the art style is not to my taste and i immensely dislike the voice acting  i do like some things about dota 2  though  lots of features that league does nt have and a bajillion of cool item actives and very unique champion kits 
2203,leagueoflegends,tried dota  it s all of the most annoying parts of league times 1000  tried smite  it s weird but i can see why people like it

2224,leagueoflegends,this is what i want to see on the front page  that malph slap was the best  d
2225,leagueoflegends,that malphite slap   ca nt stop laughing     <URL> 
2226,leagueoflegends,i only clicked to hear the song 
2227,leagueoflegends,amaze
2228,leagueoflegends,i ve played dota and i still do nt get it  i ve played heroes of the storm and love the fastpaced action as well as world of warcraft references  i m also a fan of the more firstperson oriented smite as well but i ll probably just play league
2229,leagueoflegends,with a playrate of not even 1 fucking  so the people that doing this are probably rammus mains  i hate it whenever people link highest  lowest winrate champions because championgg is not always 100  accurate and someone has to have the highest  lowest winrate 
2230,leagueoflegends,all lb had to do is get in range to q then r and this would nt have happened 
2231,leagueoflegends,lol bronze
2232,leagueoflegends,that leblanc honestly loooked like it had 1k ping
2233,leagueoflegends,look at his pick rate 
2234,leagueoflegends,well idk mabye because fiora is banned so often but she shits on him
2235,leagueoflegends,with not even 1  play rate it can be almost entirely people last picking rammus because the other team is all ad 
2236,leagueoflegends,i ve done a few games of it recently  so i ll give a quick explanation  fioramalphitegp will be your opponent in like 50  of games none of them can trade well or allin rammus without a good jungle gank  so you just farm up  shove turrets down with ultzzrot  build the buffed sunfires for great pushing and insane damage  1000 most squishies over 34 seconds  and of course apart from this such few people play him that the cheese works and all the fiora s get massively counterpicked 
2237,leagueoflegends,rammus has always been pretty strong for as long as i can remember  he s like one of those champs you just build full tank and he makes people kill themselves 
2238,leagueoflegends,    faceok 
2239,leagueoflegends,good article  but i think doublelift is amazingly under rated emily rand mentions how piglet has worse stats in multiple categories than dlift  but he has gotten less helpwhich could nt be less true tsm has put almost no resources into getting doublelift ahead and have played with hauntzer and bjerg getting camped while doublelift consistently gets dove and fucked by the enemy jungler i see a logical reason for keeping him out is his <URL> and being caught out  but there is no adc in the lcs that has done more with less attention from their team in terms of gank pressure and the team building compositions that are supposed to have them carry this is all while dlift leads his position in damage and his team 
2240,leagueoflegends,lol how fast can you post this xd  happened like half a minute ago
2241,leagueoflegends,link to a champgg page without explaining any single thing  just a link to sitenot a single wordwhat has frontpage <URL> 
2242,leagueoflegends,ok 
2243,leagueoflegends,i upvoted the first time and i still the second 
2244,leagueoflegends,better nerf swain
2245,leagueoflegends,it really isnt strong 
2246,leagueoflegends,thats good to hear now i can go rammus top when i dont get jungle 
2247,leagueoflegends,wtf 2 pushes
2248,leagueoflegends,tsm fanboys will downvote sadly 
2249,leagueoflegends,welp one fed ap mid laner can burst him gt  lt

2253,leagueoflegends,alright rito  ap is thoroughly dead  you can stahp now 
2254,leagueoflegends,i dont even know why fiora was staying mid when she had tp advantage 
2255,leagueoflegends,i just got a huge urge to watch kung fury after this song 
2256,leagueoflegends,emily rand is a joke of an analyst 
2257,leagueoflegends,maybe it will teach kaze and djoko to have some respect for the people they face  
2258,leagueoflegends,i just wanted it to keep going forever
2259,leagueoflegends,got my upvote bc this video is epic 
2260,leagueoflegends,kaze was so useless this series  one caster even pointed out  deficio   that he just gets randomly caught and dies  i have no idea what he thought when he jumped 1vs4 
2261,leagueoflegends,those are some fancy vayne mechanics fun to watch 
2262,leagueoflegends,  playstvvideo56c26b<SMILE>446c7c<SMILE>faa1

2273,leagueoflegends,even with those wins sk still looks abit shaky and alot of things to iron out if they look to even get a chance in the playoffs
2274,leagueoflegends,well duh hes has a good winrate top since he literately screams  junglers to camp his lane since he has a point and click taunt that always gon na work and no melee can beat him without dying  personal experience fighting a rammus top is not fun 
2275,leagueoflegends, this     <URL>  is the result of two of my friends blocking eachother s minions for over <SMILE>5 minutes  they bought frozen hearts and used amumu s e passive to take minimal damadge from the minions  enough so it can be regenned   after about <SMILE>0 minutes they moved and the minions started rushing against eachother in a massive war of epic proportions 
2276,leagueoflegends, this     <URL>  is what remained of blue side s minions and was enough to win the game sadly there is no way  that i know of  to see the toal count of minions but i calculated 159<SMILE> total minions  after both had started tanking and before the fight started  oh and  here     <URL>  matchdetailseuw12523102<SMILE>3<SMILE>27913070  tab  overview  is the match overview
2277,leagueoflegends,lost it at that zed flash   
2278,leagueoflegends,unlimited pretty good this series  3
2279,leagueoflegends,hi reddit  i lurk on this sub everyday and i thought it d be time to submit some doodles i ve made in hopes that you ll enjoy   i love league and undertale with a passion so i decided to combine some characters   elise as muffet     <URL>   fizz as undyne     <URL>   called it fizz the undying  oh the irony lol   zyra as flowey     <URL>   jhin as mettaton     <URL>   teemo as frisk     <URL>  i may digitalize them later  sorry for the quality  my scanner is currently down so i had to take pics with a phone  p edit   link to tumblr post     <URL> 
2280,leagueoflegends,ahri  34 appearances 
2281,leagueoflegends,press delete instead of enter helps also if you live alone shout at the screen
2282,leagueoflegends,how good is the buff to his jungle clear  tier 1 again 
2283,leagueoflegends,dear lord  how was your frame rate during this  lol
2284,leagueoflegends,it was pretty awesome  the lack of damage  follow up after was sad though 
2285,leagueoflegends,nice job walking into straight into the ball good awareness pro players 
2286,leagueoflegends,actually dr mundo did appear in cinematic xd also remember beta announcement with champions over the cliff 
2287,leagueoflegends,that s insane  how did you block the minions with just one champ 
2288,leagueoflegends,speaking purely from memory  id say if any champion was to be a poster child for lol  it would be garen he kinda suits the whole theme of league so perfectly
2289,leagueoflegends,that jhin one looks awful what gender does he identify as   looks like a really shitty orianna blitz should have been mettaton how can you fuck up something this easy 
2290,leagueoflegends,so a few things that help me  cause i get upset too but have worked on it the new queue system has helped this a ton because now i do nt need to worry about playing something i dont want to play  from best advise and down  1 play to have fun so many people forget this if you re queuing up just to prove to yourself or anyone else that you can do well then you ve got a bigger issue  2 play music and ignore negative comments  3 understand that if you really are a much better player you will eventually get out of the current rank and eventually be placed where you need to be  4 number two is important and while it may seem like you ve wasted 30 mins because you ve lost due to someone <URL> it should be a learning experience becausing losing is inevitable there is no reason to not try and at least make the best of every situation  5 too many times has this game gone from a sure win to an absolute loss giving up at 20 mins is good if you re running low on time but encouraging your team and playing the game out can lead to a wonderful win  6 play with a friend that keeps you in check someone who can calm you or give you direction the game is more fun with friends anyway  7 lastly kills are awesome and they make you feel good when you get them but you re more likely to win if you complete the objectives always have an objective in mind when your top is getting ganked by 5 people then the other 4 people on your team better be pushing lanes or doing dragon  this should all be common advise by now but thought i d type it out cause it helps remind me of whats important anyway  
2291,leagueoflegends,katarina and ryze have pretty much always been the go to advertising league  tryndamere should be on this list too considering the statue and his use in the cinematic skin or no 
2292,leagueoflegends,i ve heard of people just unbinding chat  if it s that bad i have nt felt the need to do it  but it might help you get out of the habit of flaming 
2293,leagueoflegends,can you do nasus as the greater dog 
2294,leagueoflegends,i always think of ashe because i played her during the old tutorial 
2295,leagueoflegends,i remember trying this in dota2   <URL>
2296,leagueoflegends,which  artwork appearance  featured tristana 
2297,leagueoflegends,actually <URL> good at the game  and get to an elo where people are consistently better than you when i was playing in d1 last season i was humble as fuck because i knew they were better than me 
2298,leagueoflegends, the tweet     <URL> 
2299,leagueoflegends,gt    codedasminions riot has embraced the meme
2300,leagueoflegends,yes 
2301,leagueoflegends,i remember forellenlord but i did nt watch lcs back then as much as i do now i just remember him being like top 3 in eu mids at the time  atleast from what i ve seen of him  sad he is gone
2302,leagueoflegends,it s funny cause this is an old match to me  but i still think of elise as a fairly new champion and iceborn gauntlet as a new item 
2303,leagueoflegends,git gud
2304,leagueoflegends,i miss that team the 3k elo squad sadly after creaton got injured they went downhill
2305,leagueoflegends,god damnit i miss deman 
2306,leagueoflegends,dr mundo had a cinematic which featured easter eggs of quite a few champions 
2307,leagueoflegends,this is one of those hall of fame moments of lol  what happened to him 
2308,leagueoflegends,lol baron doing no damage to ezreal
2309,leagueoflegends,what a game  air araneae throw   we all thought atn lost this game and then do nt ask me why i m an orianna main now 
2310,leagueoflegends,eu used to have fucking superb play by play casting  that was amazing to listen to again 
2311,leagueoflegends,i forgot baron and dragon had small health bars 
2312,leagueoflegends,ooooh  the memories creaton used to carry me in fantasy lcs  d yeah  forellenlord reached ridiculous 3000 elo but he had a limited champion pool pretty much orianna and lissandra  broken at that time   kerp moved to mid later and did a pretty solid job i would like to j  know what they are doing atm i follow creaton for a time and he was playing in some challenger team  a few years ago 
2313,leagueoflegends,lol i forgot how weak baron was
2314,leagueoflegends,kindred  it d basically be duck hunt 
2315,leagueoflegends,fire emblem guess the champ im talking about
2316,leagueoflegends,nidalee  sex in the wild 
2317,leagueoflegends,i think sion would be really badass in a dynasty warriors style game fizz would make sense in a 3d platformer kinda like spyro his pole could be a really cool game play element somehow i m not clever enough to figure how 
2318,leagueoflegends,3ash a7mdo
2319,leagueoflegends,how do people draw so well 
2320,leagueoflegends,teemo is the poster child  before i even started league i was making fun of people for playing him
2321,leagueoflegends,holy crap this is awesome
2322,leagueoflegends,miss fortune could be a telltale game about betrayal and meaningful choices  including tons of quicktime shooting events  that will all lead to a plethora of endings that could involve killing gangplank  finding peace with him  falling in love and quite possibly <URL> illaoi s  1 priestess  whereas karma could be one of those zen mobile games where you match blocks or colors or whatever 
2323,leagueoflegends,sometimes it helps  sometimes it makes you feel even worse  when you get totally rekt and if you already feel like shit irl  you feel worse 
2324,leagueoflegends,just like he has every day for the past 10 years   maybe 2021 is my year  when will someone undertake me   he rasps under his breath  skarner tries to drag a stool over to yorick and ends up ulting it  the chair did nt even break   who exactly  are  you   he asks  almost with pity  if someone does nt know who you are in the league  you have to be pretty low   you think that s funny  you ve been useless since your rework a few years ago   at least people know who i am  skarner chuckles  a mysterious figure is made out behind the bar  just as yorick realises who it is  he fades in   you re all a joke  you wallow in self pity when it s your fault  you just need to git gud   that s easy for you to say  you were op for almost a year when draktharr came into it  yorick exclaims with a ripple in his voice  clearly jealousy was involved   you think that did me any favours  myself amp  my comrades fell out of play for years after that  the assassins were almost eliminated entirely from the nerfs following  he s clearly getting mad  skarner knowing he can still easily lose this 1v1  slowly backs away   i guess balance  truly  is a fools master  a gelatinous figure suddenly appears just as skarner disappears   maybe you should just quit   zed    zed s face turns from anger to a pale white   wwhy are you here urgot  should nt you be on the rift  you have an <SMILE>0  win rate dammit    what good is win rate when you have a 999  ban rate   urgot sighs   i belong here with you  zed serves everybody drinks  a dead silence fills the room as they all take their sips   what s it like   yorick asks  what s what like   urgot replies inquisitively  being viable    well  it s a very mixed feeling  whilst i enjoy the raw power  i ca nt perform at my best because scrublord summoners pick me up for freelo plus i m always banned  and everybody circlejerks about me now  urgot was almost sad at the realisation that maybe it s not all it s cracked up to be   i d die to be in azir s position     your emperor has returned    azir performs his new semiglobal shurima shuffle through the window      ancient power courses through me    zed sighs with as much emphasis as he could muster   urgot it s your fault he came back you fu whatever  zed grabs a slingshot and a ball of bird feed from behind the bar  and proceeds to shoot it out of the window     i will  return   shurima   to   g  r  e  a   tn   es   s    he flies out of the window faster than yi on crack   i thought we said we were nt going to talk about him    shouts zed   my bad  forgot he could hear us  urgot says under his breath yorick finally speaks up again   i think we ve had enough champions showing up now  can we just keep it as it is   just as yorick finishes his sentence  a giant thunderstorm rose above the bar  and from it  an electrified blue dragon decends  distilling fear into everybody but urgot   ah fuck it s the new guy  urgot mutters   sorry i was just looking around  i ll go  he politely but kind of blankly says   shin  just sit there  and do nt say a word  urgot enforces   if you say so   ao says with a cheery reply  zed shakes everything off and goes back to what he last remembers talking about   besides yorick  are nt riot doing your rework this year  you ll be viable before you know it whilst we re dumpstered here   you actually believe that   yorick laughs   i m a regret  3 people played me last year and 2 of them were bets  riot does nt care anymore   as long as you do nt end up like teemo  consider yourself lucky kid  urgot says as he finishes his drink and walks out of the bar   wait  i m new here  ao says   who s teemo    we do nt usually talk about teemo  zed s almost nervous about replying  he s the only champion that s ever been removed from the rift   whoa  what  why was he removed    you d have to be there to know  a few hours later everybody went home to get ready for another day on the rift  or lack thereof  zed turns on linn  the league international news network  zed got the buff he s been waiting for  his attack speed got upped and so did his base ad  before zed can begin celebrating he listens again   rammus has been a rather weak pick since the decline of ad assassins  so we feel like he should finally get a few buffs  rammus can now jump over walls whilst rolling  his w reflects 100  of damage received from autos  and his ult includes 1s of invulnerability on cast as well as the original ult  zed is devastated he knows he ll never see a game without a rammus  a single tear rolls down his cheek  rammus rises from behind zed s chair  zed slowly turns around  and he knows exactly who s there    ok 
2325,leagueoflegends,git gud

2336,leagueoflegends,bard s game would be like viva pinata or some shit 
2337,leagueoflegends,mundo appeared in the league for mac cinematic 
2338,leagueoflegends,ahri like gta but set in the past and you kill people to get stronger so maybe something similar to shadow of mordor  if ahri can do parkour with those three dashes of her s then something like mirror s edge could also fit  edit  came up with this when i was sleepy but super mahrio 64  or ahri s champ number   where she collects wisps  souls  instead of stars  the paintings feature locations such as howling abyss and piltover  and the winged cap looks like popstar s hat and makes her fly like tails 
2339,leagueoflegends,the 5 stages of loss for a league player 1 denial 2 anger 3 league 4 league 5 league
2340,leagueoflegends,gt  not choosing manamune for the blue item gt  not using urgot for a single one of the pages i think it s time to end this relationship

2345,leagueoflegends,the nostalgia of when you look back on this too iirc around the same time that giants got back into the lcs  kerp  araneae  who was replaced by kottenx at the time   creaton and jree we re all on the same team of millennium got kicked out the lcs vs uol 
2346,leagueoflegends,yeeeee warlord shen
2347,leagueoflegends,i would personally love to follow riven on her journey as a selfimposed exile  trying to start a new life with a shattered sword  also yasuo 
2348,leagueoflegends,i just like league because it s one of the only things i do nt have to put effort in to feel like i m doing well plus it s fun to meet new people  and it s really not that hard to ignore the douches i also really like watching the meta game develop through people discovering things and basically posting them on reddit lmao  quinngraves jungle  runeglaive ez  wolf spirit pull  etc 
2349,leagueoflegends,he also rated santorin s mechanics a 9510 if faker is 1010 in an episode of summoning insight 
2350,leagueoflegends,i hate this game i just get mad and tilt this game gives me no joy and i do nt think its fun i act like i m 14 in game  yet  i cant stop its like i have to prove myself somehow 
2351,leagueoflegends,her handwriting is hard to read only problem i have with it
2352,leagueoflegends,for the people wondering  fl quit league to study 
2353,leagueoflegends,propose  like right now 
2354,leagueoflegends,so i m guessing aatrox is sobbing over a glass of jack daniel s while clutching a picture of s3 worlds eh 
2355,leagueoflegends,before you press enter  ask yourself if your comment adds value to the game  is it in game strategyinfo  ie drake  mid flash  mia   say it  will it make the game experience more positive for your allies  ie thanks  gj  wp  or even sometimes sorry shit  even light banter falls under this   say it  how do you expect your allies to respond   fuck off  do nt say it  no it was x s fault  do nt say it  sometimes it s better to take blame than to give it to the person who actually deserves it   stop    muted  do nt say it 
2356,leagueoflegends,waitwhy did teemo get removed   
2357,leagueoflegends,it helped me to get through divorce 
2358,leagueoflegends,hey all  past few weeks i decided to give it a go and create a lol stats app to track your record  view recent history  but most importantly the ability to favorite your friends  or your favorite players so that you can quickly look up their stats as well check it out in the play store  android play store link     <URL>  id  comgithubkoshkinleagueoflegendsstatsamp  hl  en  this is all 100  ad free  and pretty lightweight for that quick interactions  tell me what you think  give me some more ideas 
2359,leagueoflegends, reminds me of the time sneaky sold zerk s for a pink ward     <URL>  v  cikbqtfn0bq 
2360,leagueoflegends,uazir_the_emperor fascinating this oracle claims to see our future 
2361,leagueoflegends,to me it always felt that the worse my life felt  the better i came at the game lately tough i have not been worried at all and noticed that i also have not played as much recently as i used to my skills too have started to decay  the best i got was diamond 3  not barely could even reach platinum 4  guess i just should be happy now  
2362,leagueoflegends, imgur link     <URL>  might do more if there is interest  taking requests  edit   kalista wallpaper     <URL>

2371,leagueoflegends,ao shin 2021 confirmed
2372,leagueoflegends,i also love queuing up and having someone afk on my team for the entire match it s a big stress reliever 
2373,leagueoflegends,imo eu this split is better than people realize uol and g2 s rise has given is six teams that have a lot of potential and are all are so strong and so close together in terms of strength i wish eu had b023s this split since the series would be so close and so hotly contested 
2374,leagueoflegends,mute button exists for a reason
2375,leagueoflegends,he was just in korea to face his archenemy faker to get all the tilt out of his system
2376,leagueoflegends,no i do the same  but since riot doesnt ban ppl anymore it dosnt matter so happy flaming

2378,leagueoflegends,can you not control your hands 
2379,leagueoflegends,this is even funnier because  probably due to the beer   i ca nt quite remember which one yorick is  image search did nt help okay after a little more research i kinda remember that guy 
2380,leagueoflegends,___________________________________________________
2381,leagueoflegends,yorick s rework is confirmed to be coming out this year 
2382,leagueoflegends,rip eulcs
2383,leagueoflegends,you know that little voice in your head that tells you  do nt do it  every once in a while like when you see your motherinlaw standing at the edge of a pool  listen for it next time you re in a game  it ll work on more than just flaming teammates 
2384,leagueoflegends,i like to think things like voyboy showing riot just how overtuned olaf was  and subsequently having olaf getting nerfed so hard he became synonymous with disastrous nerfs  evelyn and kassadin were olaf d not long after   has got to be one of the more direct insights into the way the community handles riot s balance methodology which is to say  we will meme at every given opportunity 
2385,leagueoflegends,looks cool
2386,leagueoflegends,a sad lonely open world game where you try to find a friend  
2387,leagueoflegends,mfw ryu is back ___
2388,leagueoflegends,from gt  i m not even mad  this is amazing to gt  i m not even amazed  this is lol
2389,leagueoflegends,i like how you started to say  gg  in all chat when the nexus blew up 
2390,leagueoflegends,all aboard the __________________ train 
2391,leagueoflegends,ward champion on a stool  nice 
2392,leagueoflegends,i just to be a flamer but i do nt care anymore  i ca nt take this game seriously anymore  dynamic queue is a joke  going high elo  high quality game  stupid queue times  just go gold and that s it 
2393,leagueoflegends,ok  so in the new client if you pick a summoner spell  you hear the sound the spell makes in game i think it would be kinda cool to be able to hear what sound your ward makes when you place it ex  sound of skt ward skin vs penguin ward skin this would be just a small aesthetic feature that does nt add much  but would be a nice little touch to the client 
2394,leagueoflegends,yeah  but during a game you often hear someone placing a ward  at least i do   if there was too much variation  you could mistake a ward placing sound for some ability or effect 
2395,leagueoflegends,people keep suggesting these little changes to the clientthe whole thing is being remade  any work done on this one is wasted 
2396,leagueoflegends,everyone copy and paste this into those surveys they email us 
2397,leagueoflegends, now gim me ur water im serious  ______
2398,leagueoflegends,what about his front 
2399,leagueoflegends,tilt   on    oddshottvshotc9sneaky2016021673055739
2400,leagueoflegends,first time i ve seen a base rase on a c9 lol team would have been great if this happened in one of their professional games like in the c9 dota team  rip  
2401,leagueoflegends,across only 1400 games so this win rate doesnt mean shit
2402,leagueoflegends,it would have been really swell if you had just submitted this to rito instead of posting so they didnt have to disable the item 
2403,leagueoflegends,it is a lt  1  sample size not large enough to make any reliable conclusion 
2404,leagueoflegends,how does a jungle monster not being able to path it s way back to it s spawn create invsible unkillable zzrot monster        how      
2405,leagueoflegends,really shitty sample size makes this pretty irrelevant imo  maybe in a week or so when everything evens out it ll be more clear
2406,leagueoflegends,  <URL>  v  uyh3c1xdt3y
2407,leagueoflegends,i actually think ahri is getting nerfed the wrong way  charm can not cancel dashes anymore   i mean  i know ahri deserves some nerfs  but i do nt think this is a good way to nerf her  actually placing a charm while a dash is part of the potential of outplay  plus  laning against leblanc as ahri is actually already rough  it will totally destroy this lane  i actually think ahri should be more rewarded when hitting her skillshots correctly  her base damage should maybe be nerfed and the old bonus damage applied on charmed target should come back  giving more cd but reseting the cd or half cd if the target gets killed   ahri is a burst mage  or even an assassin  it s normal that she can one burst anyone  but it should happen while playing it correctly  not by spamming w r ignite  i mean  using the charm to cancel a dash is an important part of the gameplay  it punishes other s mistakes and gives counterplay  welp  i made this post most likely to know other s opinion and to share mine i know most of people are a lot salty about ahri  but i think it s understandable that this is not a good way to nerf her  at least  that s what i thought  got ta tag uvertigahri to know your opinion since you re a otp ahri 
2408,leagueoflegends,this was ahri s tool against fizzleblanccorki removing it will most likely not harm ahri a lot but it will make these champions stronger in the match up  i still ca nt think of a reason why you would nt revert her q movespeed change to the original and give charm the amplification back  but hey  it s not like it was the most obvious way of balancing ahri after the change that made her broken and began the spiral of nerfs rito too stubborn 
2409,leagueoflegends,keep in mind ahri is being shaped as more of a kite mage  maybe they think she s too good at kiting with her ms q  three dashes and the ability to interrupt dashes  this is a way of hitting that without just changing the numbers  whether or not it is justified is another conversation but this is i think riot s reasoning 
2410,leagueoflegends,i just want ahri to stop breaking my yasuo shield   those noisy basic attacks  schwoosh 
2411,leagueoflegends,what can i say  i like both games a whole lot    <URL> edit  fiddle is supposed to be ghostflying but forgot to add in ghost woops  edit 2  i kinda associated psychic in this with magic and spells  which is why ekko is not psychic he uses gadgets and stuff 
2412,leagueoflegends,ao shin  dragon   
2413,leagueoflegends,is it normal to compare these champs  typings to actual pokemons  like ahri  delphox  maokai  trevenant  azir  landorus etc 
2414,leagueoflegends,darrius is steel but draven is normal  that shit does nt fly op  1v1 me battle l iink 
2415,leagueoflegends,holy shit people are critical of this op always tread lightly bringing up pokemon on the internet  
2416,leagueoflegends,i do nt think aatrox should be darkflying his wings do nt really <URL> in use when he s fighting if anything  he should be darkfighting or just dark 
2417,leagueoflegends,is gangplank volcanion 
2418,leagueoflegends,there we go with the nerfs it was fun while it lasted    rest in peace the most ok turtle in the world  my supersonic tank 
2419,leagueoflegends,i would love a wukong one   nice wallpaper
2420,leagueoflegends,that tilted me and i was nt even in the game
2421,leagueoflegends,fuck im old
2422,leagueoflegends,why do you have to tell people now riot must stop what they are doing and fix this instead 
2423,leagueoflegends,omg nerf       it s op   
2424,leagueoflegends,1 janna ult was fucking bad  2 before reload he used one auto on a creep or reksai cant really tell  3 the corki penta    my bad he didnt missed an auto he just used e 
2425,leagueoflegends,i wonder if anivia can wall block invisible minions
2426,leagueoflegends,i m really glad the video description on youtube gave me the runes and masteries  gt  runes gt  red  marks   9x flat ad gt  yellow  seals   9x armor gt  blues   glyphs  <SMILE>x scaling mr amp  1 crit chance gt  quints  3x attack speed gt  masteries  121<SMILE>0 with thunderlord s decree
2427,leagueoflegends,this will tilt people for generations to come 
2428,leagueoflegends,after months passed and people started to realized zzrot portal s true strength  and abuse it with cho  udyr and then they discovered something more terrifying  unkillable  invincible  invisible  game breaking spaghetti monsters summoned by the void portal oh  what have we done
2429,leagueoflegends,sounds really nice indeed
2430,leagueoflegends,zzrot minions coded as bugs
2431,leagueoflegends, guess i ll be the first to post this     <URL> 
2432,leagueoflegends,reminds me of this    <URL>  v  xdtxfhbvzto
2433,leagueoflegends,they are trying to remove skill from this game 
2434,leagueoflegends,okay i can never play jhin or graves now ever this tilted me just watching
2435,leagueoflegends,disclaimer  i have no idea how repeatable this bug is  or if its fixed by the time ive posted about it i ll leave my method at the very bottom of the post  but i cant guarantee it will work  so  the enemy team in my most recent game have found a game crashing bug  placing a handful of zzrot portals can bug minions or zzrot voidlings making them invincible  in a sense   when they die  they appear to die  except  they still provide minion block  and occasionally move around the map  this meant  that after a while of build up  lanes would be impassable  you would have to walk through jungle to progress through the lane  countless minions would get stuck on the invisible dead minions on top of that  they can still be seen on the map  they would do some strange movements  where what appears to be 3040 minions would charge down the lane on the map  but nothing in game  all of this eventually  slowed down the game  created lag  lowered frames  and then crashed the game i d noticed prior to the weird minion behavior  that the portals were being placed in the krug camps  preventing the bigger krug from sitting in its proper position  meaning it would constantly be in a reset mode whether this is why the whole fiasco happened is difficult to say  also  crashing the game seems to prevent it from appearing on my match history  the game was already bugged well before i started recording  we had already noticed lag  and frame rate drops  the other team as well as my friends who were nt recording were experiencing huge frame rate drops  it was nt the screen cap that caused this error  sorry for the lack of editing  i do nt feel like doing it    youtubeb4n7cbwgy4 my understanding of how they did it  buy a zzrot portal place it at the nearest krug camp  making sure its behind iton top of it  then protect it and let as many spawn as possible  if this does nt work  sorry  no idea how they did it  i was nt the creatordiscoverer of this  just sharing the fun  additional video  a friends perspective     <URL>  v  3c7a2g9ucs0
2436,leagueoflegends,gt  i d noticed prior to the weird minion behavior  that the portals were being placed in the krug camps  preventing the bigger krug were you talking about  this     <URL>  
2437,leagueoflegends,oddshots so fucking garbage u cant replay at a specific time after the video has finished and it autoplays into some garbage i dont want to see  best update ever
2438,leagueoflegends,he forgot how to reload cancel
2439,leagueoflegends,if riot wants to balance ahri for both lower and higher skill levels of play they should aim to hit her where she is overbearing  not in a way that only lowers her skill ceiling while doing nothing else as such i will propose some possible solutions to balance her for every level of play  reduce or remove the movement speed on her q early game  i said this last year and i m going to say it again this year ahri s primary problem is how easy it is for her to reach her midgame powerspike this problem entirely stems from the massive movement speed boost her q gives her before level 6 as she is simply too difficult to shut down a very easy way to fix this problem would be to tie the movement speed her q gives her to the rank of her ultimate at the moment it simply gives 215 movement speed decaying to <SMILE>0 over 05 seconds when cast if it gave 0 until she reached level 6 she would be much easier to shut down then it could give a third of the current boost for each rank of her ultimate  culminating at the current values at level 16 this also makes sense thematically as her signature mobility skill is her ultimate so her lesser form of mobility should be tied to it  increase the cooldown on charm at lower levels if the cooldown on charm was 1615141312 based on rank it would  fit  more with the other cc skills of every other caster examples include syndra whose stun scales from 1<SMILE>12  lux binding 1511  anivia q 12<SMILE>  brand stun <SMILE>6  leblanc chains 14<SMILE> and many other champions in addition to being more consistent with other spells of similar purpose it would also punish ahri players that toss the spell around for no reason currently the spell can be tossed around with very little punishment  especially in midgame stalemates and a nerf like this would allow opponents a window to advance on ahri players this is especially true since charm is generally maxed last  so the effects of a nerf like this will be very noticeable during skirmishes and midgame fights  change her passive first of all ahri s passive does not fit thematically and i have had a problem with it for a while now she does not walk into a crowd of people and absorb essence from all of them she lures single targets out where their friends can not help them and then drains them when they are defenseless this is not reflected on her current passive which encourages her to toss her orb at a wave of minions to heal up additionally this passive has virtually no counterplay aside from using yasuo or braum wall to block the orb and can heal her for more than 75  of her health with some ap easily this makes poke ineffective against her as it is already difficult to hit her with her q movement speed  but now she just farms a wave and is back at full health changing it would give some counterplay back to her opponents i will suggest an idea  passive  essence theft whenever ahri damages a champion that is under the effects of a stun  taunt  knockup or charm she heals for 15  of her targets maximumcurrent health  between her autoattacks and skills and assuming a 2s cc duration  ahri can heal for 3  from orb  45  from foxfire  3  from 2 ult charges and 3  from 2 autoattacks as well as a possible 15  from charming chaining a target already locked this being a total of 15  of her targets maximumcurrent health while the numbers can be adjusted this passive makes much more sense ahri preys on the defenseless and targets with stronger life force should probably be more succulent this change also means that she can not sustain up for free while also forcing her to take risks if she wants to heal this introduces counterplay as dodging cc skills will remove her ability to sustain  to the argument that changing charm to not cancel dashes being a consistency move i would like to argue that charm is one of the most unique and iconic skills in the game it should not have exactly the same properties as a stun or root because it is nt one additionally thematically ahri has the ability to stop people  dead in their tracks  as shown in riots  stray fox  short story charm being able to cancel dashes is the perfect embodiment of that ability to stop people  dead in their tracks  and should therefore not be removed from the game 
2440,leagueoflegends,this is a dumb nerf in my book because it does the one thing league does nt need to do more of  removing unique aspects of champions kits 
2441,leagueoflegends,how fed are you guys to 1000 anyone  i can only 1000 squishies later on in the game and thats by using reqw and probably ignite if they have bt shield what are you guys building 
2442,leagueoflegends,you ca nt carry any game as ahri fed ahri is like fed support 
2443,leagueoflegends,this is so sad actually balance changes that remove core gameplay is questionable why not reduce her base damages and increase scaling  why not just increase the charm cd if it s so problematic ahri gets too much love  in turn too much hate it s not the kit s fault if she has a dedicated player population winrates i think are naturally supposed to go up with more experience with the champ  just punish mistakes and reward good play  do nt go for a halfassed nerf 
2444,leagueoflegends,and that s why jhin will probably not be seeing much of competitive play 
2445,leagueoflegends,     
2446,leagueoflegends,at its core  the change is a bug fix to make it consistent with similar effects  charm is a taunt  not a displacement effect and by definition it should not interrupt movement  turning a blind eye to strange interactions is fine when a champion is weak  but ahri has been a solid pick for years 
2447,leagueoflegends,guess whos back 
2448,leagueoflegends,and that s why the last shot should crit on structures jhin sacrifices dps in exchange for burst in the form of a guaranteed crit 
2449,leagueoflegends,9ms  
2450,leagueoflegends,zzrot disabled here in na  although riot has put no indication in their client  smh 
2451,leagueoflegends,back again 
2452,leagueoflegends,very fond of their choice to have it at shanghai  mainly for my personal memories of the first league of legend i ever watched was the allstar event  while environmental hazards could be of a concern  the chinese fans are passionate and i can not wait to watch this event from the comfort of my home 
2453,leagueoflegends,take note everyone  this is what  gamebreaking  means when it comes to bugs 
2454,leagueoflegends,this is like something out of a creepy short story  they can not be seen or killed they just keep showing up they do nt hurt you directly  just keep crowding around  bogging you down can you go that way  or is it blocked  if you start through  you will be slowed down  every move you make allows them to surround you more there is no escape 
2455,leagueoflegends,every game i lost this season was because of this bug i would be challenger otherwise so please rito put my account in challenger thanks
2456,leagueoflegends,did you try pd passive  movement through minion spell like ghost  etc 
2457,leagueoflegends,this has already been posted before as well as the reproduction steps i tried it and it s hit or miss but if you get the hang of it  you can produce it most of the time what happens is when the portal gets stuck in a wall pushed by a jungle monster  it will summon invisible voidlings every half a second and will go to the nearest lane with high ms small and large visible voidlings will still appear regularly the invisible voidlings will try to follow  and attack  minions but will not do damage nor expire if they do nt have any minions to target  they will clump to the nearest turret or inhibitor  blocking it effectively that your melee minions ca nt even attack it  successfully doing it one time can block a few minions but doing it more than twice can block an entire lane if the enemy inhibitor is down  invisible voidlings might even block the spawn areas and in some occasions spread on other lanes  when coming from mid  of course you can do this on other lanes to start with  
2458,leagueoflegends,it would hurt if lpl teams do nt perform  chinese community is salty as fk  best memers 
2459,leagueoflegends,brings back memories from cod zombies xd
2460,leagueoflegends,syndra needs to be psychic floating balls 
2461,leagueoflegends,that s actually one of the funniest things i ve ever seen props to them for syncing it so well i m surprised rengar did nt notice tp on adc but it looks like he would be fucked either way oh how the tables have turned for rengar this season xd
2462,leagueoflegends,repost i ve remembered this video because of riven did you steal it for karma  edit  are these downvotes for real  i m serious that this was posted before  it seems too familiar to not be a repost this better not be your friends 
2463,leagueoflegends,i mainly play jaina and artanis in hots  are there any characters in lol that are similar  what should i know in the beginning  how does the item shop works  and which characters are good for beginner in lol  sorry if this question is asked 100 times a day  i just really want to switch over to lol  edit  damn nice  thought i would get down voted into oblivion  thanks to this nice community   edit2  okay  this really exploded somehow i thank everyone for those nice tips downloading it atm and i ca nt wait to check it out  d
2464,leagueoflegends,wow these guys are giving shit advice  hey  league is fun  the people are fairly nice   seriously which game doesnt have mean people   the whole toxic thing is blown out of proportion just dive in  pick the coolest looking champ and wreck shit 
2465,leagueoflegends,play annie he is even somewhat similar to some hots characters u need to last hit minions keep that in mind 
2466,leagueoflegends,itt  some good advice  bad memes and a bad  do nt  joke 
2467,leagueoflegends,rule  1 of league is teamwork  
2468,leagueoflegends,you re gon na have a hard time  buddy you re trying to jump from the ground to a ladder that s double your height above you 
2469,leagueoflegends,mute all  comes in handy
2470,leagueoflegends,really happy to see that the iwc will be played in mexico city  especially considering how quickly lan has grown and this will help even further 
2471,leagueoflegends,woah woah woah  are you telling me someone has actually used the phrase  game breaking  correctly 
2472,leagueoflegends,makes sense gives the biggest fanbase a chance to host an international event hopefully it will all go well and there wo nt be any visa issues double rr is better as well 
2473,leagueoflegends,you forgot something  the music suddenly changed it s raining men started blasting over the speakers   oh shit  skarner whispered   he s here  gems of all different colors came bursting through the door  putting on a rainbow light show  stunning everyone in the bar   thatthat s outrageous  screamed zed   truly outrageous   muttered urgot under his breath  taric stood at the door  hair flowing behind him   so  who wants to be dazzled by my new rework  
2474,leagueoflegends,makes sense gives the biggest fanbase a chance to host an international event hopefully it will all go well and there wo nt be any visa issues 
2475,leagueoflegends,feel like if janna would have saved her ult they would have won could have just pushed whole enemy team away but then again in hindsight it s easy for me to say
2476,leagueoflegends,trundle pillar clutched that pushed their whole team together  the nexus was literally 1 hit what the shit  how do you even play another game after that 
2477,leagueoflegends,this was brutal to watch reloading sucks man
2478,leagueoflegends,i ll take the chance to leave this here since making an own post seemed a bit much to me  jhin buff idea gt  make his 4rth auto deal bonus damage on turrets to make up a little for his weak pushing power
2479,leagueoflegends,watch stuff
2480,leagueoflegends,so this is actually a really old trick with tp if one person starts the tp on an object  their animation will be the only one that displays you can have your entire team tp onto the same minion and after the first it will just look like people are appearing 
2481,leagueoflegends,that no one ever was 
2482,leagueoflegends,well he would nt return to try to be the worst 
2483,leagueoflegends,<URL>
2484,leagueoflegends,his best  so not that good 
2485,leagueoflegends,for some reason i thought braum was gon na dash to mf and fly across the map 
2486,leagueoflegends,when you play vs bots do nt focus on killing the bot but focus on trying to last hit minions when you do it enough you ll learn the pattern pro players even practice vs bots to cs as it s the main fundamental skill you need in this game if you ca nt cs you re never getting out of bronze 
2487,leagueoflegends,before understanding the game a lot  play a lot and just mess around have fun   when you start understanding the game  it gets quite stressful 
2488,leagueoflegends,do nt do it  do nt  get out while you still can i believe in you 
2489,leagueoflegends,very cool trick  i think the pros could pull this off with a double tp comp  or the double tp onto one ward communication would be the key though 
2490,leagueoflegends,dance
2491,leagueoflegends,try to convince some friends to play with you  league is way more fun whilst playing together
2492,leagueoflegends,prepare for the saltlots of fucking salt
2493,leagueoflegends,biggest change for me when i played hots after playing lol for years was not buying items i couldnt get over it idk why but it made the game feel simple and characters were only allowed one role or so it felt when i played at release have nt gone back they have <URL> builds but i would also <URL> looking them up for the current season all of the 450 champs are pretty decent especially poppy she was recently reworked so i d <URL> getting them first do not buy runes until you re sumoner level 20 and can buy tier 3 runes otherwise you re wasting ip  influence points you gain from games   another thing is lanes i dont recall lanes being much of a thing in hots  but the na meta rn is a solo top lane which is generally a tankybruiser charecter with a jungle also will most likely be tankybruiser but they do have assassin jungles as well  then you got solo mid which is generally a ranged ap champ finally on bottom you got 2 champs 1  adc  attack damage carry  theyre job is to get fed and stack a bunch of ad  attack speed and crit chance the other on bottom is the support  generally a champ with good crowd control or healing abilities  or both  sorry for wall of text i can just think of a lot of little tips for someone starting 
2494,leagueoflegends,inb4  visa issues  keep a star player out for all non chinese teams 
2495,leagueoflegends,my butt has never been so clenched in a game before
2496,leagueoflegends,so you put no weight on the fact that you could get a teemo or tf credit card 
2497,leagueoflegends,returning or not atleast he got a big package
2498,leagueoflegends,i posted this as a comment on the actual page but figured i could put it here as well  having attended msi last year i am glad about some of the changes   double round robin format taking away the bluered side bias  extending the group stage to more days  last year having 15 matches in 2 days was crazy  and it ran so late locally we did not get to have meet and greets most days the change to having 30 matches in 5 days basically means that we are having 25 less matches a day   splitting the semifinal matches into separate days is also a smart idea as most people left or the crowd was dead last year after the sktvsfnatic semifinal  the only thing that worries me is the extended time  last year msi ended and 10 days later lck started  if they expect teams to compete and then 3 days later start their summer split  i could see some of the top tier teams choosing not to go  edit  formatting
2499,leagueoflegends,expanding the amount of games but not the amount of teams is quite stupid i dont want to see a team getting stomped 5 times by the same team at least make it 2 groups of 3 and not one of 6 i wouldnt even mind to have 2 teams participating from the major regions  eu and na 
2500,leagueoflegends,good  that was enjoyable 
2501,leagueoflegends,that no one ever was 
2502,leagueoflegends,i refuse to let myself get too hyped up just yet not again 
2503,leagueoflegends,good luck cj 
2504,leagueoflegends,seems like ive heard the name what was his previous team 
2505,leagueoflegends,the reason that he wants to be the best is the same reason he wo nt come back soon 
2506,leagueoflegends,remember when urgot was 100  pickban on the international stage  that was last year 
2507,leagueoflegends,lmao players wont be able to breathe the air
2508,leagueoflegends,i had a yorick on my team yesterday against a top lane fiora  i do nt know how  but by 15 minutes he was 50 against her 
2509,leagueoflegends,total opposite effect for me  stresses me out and makes me miserable if i lose or do poorly 
2510,leagueoflegends,ok 
2511,leagueoflegends,i started to play lol after about 2000 games of hots  and jaina was my most played hero in ranked  i hate artanis though   so we re in similar positions  here s what i can tell you   the champions in lol are more complex than the heroes in hots  in general   and there are a lot more of them this means it will take you a lot longer to get to the point where you can counter play effectively you ll probably feel quite lost in your first games due to the sheer amount of gamechampion knowledge that you re still lacking   you might be disappointed in how most matches unfold compared to hots hots has a more modern design  you spend more time of the game doing interesting stuff compared to lol there are 10 different maps  which keeps the game experience diversified and fresh in league of legends you ll find that most matches amount to a laning phase followed by a very drawn out team fight in the mid lane this is not true for higher ranked games  but you wo nt be in high ranked games for a  long  time in other words  you might actually be very disappointed by that aspect of lol  overall flow of the game    related to the above  league of legends  like dota  has a  laning phase  which is usually at least 15 minutes long  and that you spend farming gold from minions  and trying to outplay your lane opponent  s   only  very  very rarely  are these first 15 minutes of the game more interesting than the first 15 minutes of a hots game  hots games only last 20 minutes on average   and you have to do it in every game  regarding your specific question  jaina is a backline damage dealer that depends a lot on good positioning and clever application of your crowd control artanis is your typical tanky melee bruiser  with that in mind  you ll probably enjoy morgana  lux  orianna  leblanc morgana and lux are both good because you can play them solo in the mid lane and as support champions in the bot lane  artanis corresponds to champions like fiora  riven  volibear  malphite  hecarim  shyvana  who are tanky and still capable of dealing damage  unfortunately it s not easy to compare lol and hots in this fashion  because the games are designed quite differently  and so are the heroes  i like to play tanks in hots  because it gives me a lot of control over team fights  but in lol i do nt really care about that  because full blown team fights are more rare  and tanks play differently  so at the end of the day you have to try out all roles and enough champions to find out for yourself  you should also refer to the following sources for information   championgg  the league of legends wiki  youtube and twitch to be honest i find most of the guide websites pretty bad  the average quality of the guides is low there are good ones but you wo nt find them easily while you still need them 
2512,leagueoflegends,  <URL> remembered seeing this after the twitch needs skins thread  looks sick
2513,leagueoflegends,can twitch ever get a skin that looks coolgood instead of gross  except ssw or pickpocket ones 
2514,leagueoflegends,i ve really liked the guy  
2515,leagueoflegends,thanks for the shitpost 
2516,leagueoflegends,drama averted  let s pack up boys  we re going home 
2517,leagueoflegends,but what about daydreamin  where on earth has miles hoard gone 
2518,leagueoflegends,maybe he can regain his form but in brazil he was nt as good as expected  he was still the better korean on that keyd lineup though 
2519,leagueoflegends,that  s what i  ve been looking for daydream was reaaaaally good back in the short neoblaze days with emperor
2520,leagueoflegends,i made my mistakes in the past i wo nt get excited
2521,leagueoflegends,they are really desperate
2522,leagueoflegends,holy shit cj fans please do nt die of faith overdose
2523,leagueoflegends,you have so much to learn there are gon na be an infinite number of situations where you say  what the fuck just happened  or  how the fuck did they do that  or  master yi is the bane of my existence   stick with it  learn the game  play champs that you find enjoyable and you ll have a great experience 
2524,leagueoflegends,at first i read  daydreamin  and i was like  what the hell is he doing in a korean team   now i wonder what he  been up to 
2525,leagueoflegends,you re missing a few riven artworks 
2526,leagueoflegends,i still don  t understand why they kept ambition instead of trick
2527,leagueoflegends,always trust big regi when it comes down to team decisions 
2528,leagueoflegends,so daydream replacing bubbling  and ghost and bdd going to tear shit up  sounds like a cj fan s wet dreamhopefully they do nt let everyone down we all know what happens when you start having faith in them haha
2529,leagueoflegends,i m so happy about this i ll start supporting cj entus again 
2530,leagueoflegends,blurred limes coach chris will make a return to restore law and order would like to see him on tsm legends blasting off on bjerg and sven to be up by 7 for breakfast tsm stealing off clg staff and players
2531,leagueoflegends,paging uycitizensnipsy another korean that used to play in a subpar region in the lck  those korean choaches must be insane 
2532,leagueoflegends,i m sorry but i ca nt stop laughing when i read this line    after last year  s msi  we wanted to see more region vs region matches    what year is this   
2533,leagueoflegends,i ll stick with kingpin 
2534,leagueoflegends,oh man i cant wait for bdd and ghost now
2535,leagueoflegends,gt  no ear on the back op  you failed jk
2536,leagueoflegends,they want a life coach  hire a mom these people need a mommy in house
2537,leagueoflegends,league is something different than other gt  moba s games i do nt why just the spark in that game 
2538,leagueoflegends,you should add hats as a category teemo hats are literally everywhere  and corki  rammus  and lulu hats are also popular  also something something teemo and evelynn are invisible something something 
2539,leagueoflegends,i got 63k ip which champ do you guys suggest  was leaning to quinngraves 
2540,leagueoflegends,quinn by long shot 
2541,leagueoflegends,go quinn  she will no doubt get gutted due to her ability to top jungle and adc really well  but that said she can still play all 3 of those roles well otherwise out of standard top laners i d go gnar  i do nt play him myself  a good gnar can carry really well  or renekton
2542,leagueoflegends,both of those will be overnerfed and unusable pretty soon hopefully get malphite if you do nt have him  maybe gnar if you want a ranged champion
2543,leagueoflegends,i have nt seen anyone say tahm yet he s kinda not fair i have 70  win rate with him
2544,leagueoflegends,msg again  fuck yes 
2545,leagueoflegends,they ca nt even make one stop in canada 
2546,leagueoflegends,alright  i m so disappointed 
2547,leagueoflegends,the lab rat one lt  3
2548,leagueoflegends,not going to happen cause of cigar
2549,leagueoflegends,f
2550,leagueoflegends,both are really awesome labrat isa really really cool concept 
2551,leagueoflegends,guess who s back  back again ryu s back  tell a friend
2552,leagueoflegends,i m sure zyra was in a cinematic too   it seems there are a few champions being missed out or am i missing a rule about it  o
2553,leagueoflegends,nice work
2554,leagueoflegends,i learned this on trick s stream  whenever someone does something stupid hed type random letters and just spam the keyboard in 1 message he called it rage language and it takes the steam off and worked for me
2555,leagueoflegends,that venue looks fancy as fuck
2556,leagueoflegends,just why 
2557,leagueoflegends,id try to shut the fuck up if i were you  have you ever tried that 
2558,leagueoflegends, quite a surprise to me  someone at riot really must have a soft spot for the guy  there was a time  20122013  nocturne was the god of the game if you heard nocturne ult  you could hear  an enemy has been slain  the second following it so imo  nocturne had his glory day and nobody can deny it  d
2559,leagueoflegends,had this been the 2015 team  maybe kc would have been a person who fit well for this position  but for this team in particular  it seems like the sort of internal issues within the team requires a different person with different experiences to help them out 
2560,leagueoflegends,damn thats like the other side of the world  
2561,leagueoflegends,he is high every noon so me he eats a lot of junk food while high and got fat
2562,leagueoflegends,this is like allstars all over again sadface
2563,leagueoflegends,its not too late im sure riot can make changes  pretty sure riot may end up doing a worlds exhibition matches in montreal canada considering how many cry baby canadians kick up a big fuss about not having any riot events there 
2564,leagueoflegends,not doing anything became boring after a while so i decided to take up an impossible task i will attempt to make a video explaining what i consider basic concepts and maybe more complex ones later to players  with the number of hitbox related posts that regularly reach the front page  it s clear to me that people have a hard time understanding hitboxes  models and perspective so that s going to be my first video  here are some of the things i m going to try to explain in the video   the fact that lol is a mechanically 2d game it does not have a z axis and all  jumps  actually make the hitbox  dash   that is why you can do stuff like flayhookhit people mid air     <URL>  hitboxes are cylinders  circles in 2d  around champions that will try to contain the champion model and most of it s animations  including running  because of this  hitboxes will contain a lot of  empty space  on the left and right of a character model  everything that is red counts as the hitbox       <URL>  a good example of this would be hecarim that has a long but not wide model he s also a bruiser so he has a naturally big hitbox with a lot of empty space  as long as the middle of a skillshot hits the edge of his hitbox  it will count as a hit   the circle is hecarim s correct hitbox       <URL>    here s a nice representation of how this would work the circles in the start are the exact hitboxes for blitz and ori it then shows the normal point of view and how it looks like from third person view     <URL>    keep in mind that if a skillshot connects anywhere on the hitbox  it will jump to the middle of it so it looks pretty   so in the end  tell me what would you like to know about hitboxes so i can make a good video the links in this thread wo nt make it into the video as they are rushed and look ugly so everything is still a wip 
2565,leagueoflegends,if you were to make a video talk about if champion s have different size hitboxes  ie who has the biggest who has the smallest  are there any weird hitbox things you know about like if you stand beside a wall you can abuse a hitbox etc someone made a thresh video about abusing the hitbox on people in minion waves stuff liek that is really good anything you think will be interesting or informative really 
2566,leagueoflegends,make sure to include tahm kench q in your research
2567,leagueoflegends,i could see this coming but definitely not so soon sorry to hear about this  i wonder if tsm will revert back to their headless chicken running ways without a solid leader such as regi 
2568,leagueoflegends,muteall
2569,leagueoflegends,mute all
2570,leagueoflegends,cassio was in 2 cinematics and you cant even write her name properly  thats so sad  i hope the little fanbase of her gets a good rework so we finaly can ssssslither back in our holes
2571,leagueoflegends,ghost and bdd hype  now daydream  omg pls cj do nt let me down
2572,leagueoflegends,nice work i was completely expecting a blank sketch as a joke 
2573,leagueoflegends,maybe verbally insult them without typing it out i personally do nt get mad anymore at all 
2574,leagueoflegends,i still think it s a huge mistake to fire a coach who has only been with the org for a few months just because he is nt up to par yet if that is literally the only reason he was being let go then why are the players also not being let go  they definitely had nt been performing to expectation until their game against clg  which still was nt mind blowing  makes me wonder if this was nt another instance of regi trying to step in too much and undermining the authority of kc there s a reason the owners of traditional sports are nt involved in the coaching of the team at all or it could be the players  having no background in traditional sports  got their ego s bruised a bit by the coaching methods that kc brought and tucked their tails and went to papa regi or  he could have legit just been bad at his job as the announcement implies  i think the most likely scenario is that it was a combination of all of those situations  but i m not privy to any inside information  he could have stolen leena s candy bar for all i know  i do want to reiterate  regi should not  in any way  be involved in the coaching of the team if he wants his players to respect a hired coach he should either coach the team  or own the team if you ve hired someone to coach  let them coach if they <URL> ineffective  fire them  hire a new coach  but do not step in and undermine their authority 
2575,leagueoflegends,dj khaled new tsm life coach plz
2576,leagueoflegends,the only champions i knew about before playing league a few months ago were lee sin  darius  fizz  caitlyn  wukongjinx  and of course  teemo  i know im not everyone but those are the ones i was hearing about
2577,leagueoflegends,gnar not just that he is very fun he is one of the better top champ to master  he has very little counters and he is very rewardful to learn be ready for a long and tough learning curve if u need help u can always msg me
2578,leagueoflegends,before you craft any top lane champions  get dr boom 
2579,leagueoflegends,as someone with deep insider knowledge of tsm  this certainly means lt  jump to conclusion heregt 
2580,leagueoflegends,vladimir is a good champ  and a simple one for doing well top lane  rumble is a personal favorite 
2581,leagueoflegends,yorick
2582,leagueoflegends,did the item actually got disabled when i had the components i hate you 
2583,leagueoflegends,renekton will always be a good option between graves or quinn though  i d say quinn gnar is also a great option 
2584,leagueoflegends,i actually had exactly this kind of problem too i just hide the chat so i cant even see if someone is blaming me  that way i could concentrate way more on me and my performance another tip is that you just take a break when you had a bad game play other games with your friends or just spectate them while they are playing  its really relaxing and will definitely calm you down hope my tips helped you a bit  
2585,leagueoflegends,go with the crock  you never can go wrong he does nt need to build a lead  he starts with a strong early game  has a dash so being out of position can be less punishing  hard cc  sustain and the most bm skin of all  pool party renekton with the bm recall  buy now  buy fast crocodile dundee awaits you want fun and consistency  avoid flavor of the month picks  quinn graves etc  they are cheese right now but who knows what will happen  fiora with her swift playstyle and her ability to deflect cc or irelia the sustain ops i bursted you outta knowhere and now i even stun you to oblivion  garen  the i do nt want to to silence spin and ulti you but ok ur dead wukong  the win team fight beyblade inc  darius  the i make taking cs in my lane a pain  oh hi ur dead
2586,leagueoflegends,poppy is decent 
2587,leagueoflegends,do nt press this button and you ll be  fine     <URL> 
2588,leagueoflegends,if you like farming for half an hour and then destroying everyone  play nasus walk into a 1v3 with your ult late game  and you just do nt die  with the proper items he s also only 1350 ip  and teaches you how to last hit  since his q is reliant on it  also nunu is good  if you do nt mind being hated with his q  consume  you can just regain health while bullying with ice ball it s fun lol 
2589,leagueoflegends,snoopeh suggested himself for head coach as a reply to tsm s tweet announcement i would be down for this 
2590,leagueoflegends,get taric nobody expects taric top then you just rub your gems all over their face 
2591,leagueoflegends,is this a singed thread i smell  
2592,leagueoflegends,disappointed there is nt anything being held down south like in texas
2593,leagueoflegends,from watching tsm legends it seemed like kc s lack of understanding for the game really attributed to the apparent barrier between him and the players 
2594,leagueoflegends,no one suggested malphite  the hell 
2595,leagueoflegends,in the illustration it says   eternal champions  draven  yasuo  eguchi and twisted fate 
2596,leagueoflegends,kennan is always good in any patch for the past 2 seasons

2604,leagueoflegends,speaking of cinematics  where is our season 6 cinematic  rito plz
2605,leagueoflegends,it s fun how riot used to reward ahri players for hitting the e with a damage buff  but they just traded that for a shit ton of utility which just sucks imo 
2606,leagueoflegends,they booked the chicago theater serious rito  it only seats 3500 people really dumb 
2607,leagueoflegends,hi i made a dumb aatrox comic not long ago and i decided to do one for every champion  so here s the first set i m so sorry   aatrox     <URL>   ahri     <URL>   akali     <URL>   alistar     <URL>   amumu     <URL>   anivia     <URL>   annie     <URL>  also i might draw your comments have fun   edit    some of these requests are incredible but unfortunately i do nt have time to draw them all but i  do  plan to have a livestream and take those requests on  twitch     twitchtvnoobthelosrr  at some point  or you can follow my  facebook     <URL>   where i ll post when i m planning to do the stream

2617,leagueoflegends,working for reginald and trying to coach bjergsen  doublelift and svenskeren  yea  i would nt leave my day job for that 
2618,leagueoflegends,who tsm needs is a manager who is willing to throw a shoe at bjergsen  regi needs to hire sir alex ferguson

2621,leagueoflegends,you deserve freaking gold for this explanation i am so glad someone took the time to explain this 
2622,leagueoflegends,sent 
2623,leagueoflegends,unfortunately  if you can not hold back from typing negative things that are nt constructive in game  there s not much to do aside from stop typing  which you said you do nt like doing  biggest thing i d <URL> is that you should try to recognize that a  in every scenario  in every situation that goes badly  where you might try to chat to attack or belittle your teammates  instead try to rethink the situation into a  what more could i have done there   rather than  what more could they have done there    it helps you shift frustration into a learning tool  and redirects potential anger you have towards teammates towards yourself or the game if you do this  you can make negative experiences into somewhat helpful learning experiences  b  unless you phrase your comments very specifically  your chat wo nt be seen as criticisms  but rather as just insults the easiest way to get less toxic when you chat to other players is that you work on how you say things understand that if you see a teammate die 4 times in a row top lane against riven  you saying  you fucking suck stop feeding  does nt <URL> anything at all instead  do nt make reference to how bad they are doing  but give a criticism or advice all the same  something along the lines of  hey  you should play more passively and build armor  and just sit tight so riven does nt snowball anymore   c  you need to be more humble  less proud  in game this one is usually the hardest for toxic players to <URL> because they typically view themselves as superior to their fellow players  and it causes you to react in a way that you feel the need to control or influence the game more than you are by just playing your champion trust me on this one  if you can change your mindset in game from  these idiots suck  why ca nt i get good teammtes  to  these guys are having bad games  and there is nt much i can do to stop that aside from playing well  from  they re doing these obviously bad plays that i would never make  to  i ca nt play for them  so i should just do as good as i can and help if they need it  from  i know what they are doing wrong and they should stop doing said thing  to  they probably know that they are doing poorly  i should just do my best and move on  in every scenario  you should be focusing on yourself and how you play  and recognize that chatting negatively wo nt help at all if you change your viewpoint  no matter what  seriously  to  i m the only person i should be criticizing  it not only improves your play  it helps reduce the negativity you feel and act on in game 
2624,leagueoflegends,i think riot just does nt know if they would sale 1<SMILE>k tickets in chicago so they did nt risk renting the venue also larger venues can be used even if nothing is listed because some places need days to setup im honestly more shocked they did nt do a toronto event yet 
2625,leagueoflegends,great video and i am glad thorin points out woodbucks overuseage of buzzwords 
2626,leagueoflegends,i m just curious as to how you got that background seen behind summoners rift in this  gif     <URL> 
2627,leagueoflegends,tldw from anyone who watched 
2628,leagueoflegends,paging utranscribesstuff  d
2629,leagueoflegends,i wonder why they chose dravenyastf for his artwork  were they the br player s top 3 champs 
2630,leagueoflegends,first you take our servers now you want to take our audience  fuck off east coast
2631,leagueoflegends,worlds is a huge logistical challenge has anyone considered that a larger venue represents substantially more work that riot may not be prepared to do as they bang around america for worlds 
2632,leagueoflegends,i m from highland park and i d have to agree its pretty fucked up 
2633,leagueoflegends,outside of thorin s twitter trolling  thorin s content has been fucking great 
2634,leagueoflegends,hey  just wondering how you know what the exact info is for the hit boxes  i know that there are generally 3 model sizes   yordle  human  bruiser   and then there are the other sizes  nasus ult  renekton ult  cho with stacks  and then there is also the elixir of iron  how do you know the exact hitbox values  what about the exact hitboxes of the skillshots  is there a file or place that you can go to look up this information  cheers  
2635,leagueoflegends,fiddle a flying type  he s a fucking scarecrow it should be darkground if anything 
2636,leagueoflegends,just wondering  how d they know his name and what he looked like  or even that he passed 
2637,leagueoflegends,i really like riotbr they are awesome  always making good events and very attentive to their playerbase 
2638,leagueoflegends,you are mainly correct  except the hittboxes are done squares not circles 
2639,leagueoflegends,i rather remain mad
2640,leagueoflegends,riot should nt sell tickets  they should give them to the survivors of a free for all death match in chicago 
2641,leagueoflegends,i think firing kc was a good move for tsm even though it sucks to see someone lose their job his experience coaching at any level was suspect and he just did nt seem to be able to motivate the players kind of seemed lost and out of place in the esports environment quite frankly 
2642,leagueoflegends,holy shit that amumu one 
2643,leagueoflegends,really great work  can you possibly make talon carrying 6 longswords lol
2644,leagueoflegends,viktor being disappointed about the glorious eeveelution  cassiopeia ulting a mirror

2657,leagueoflegends,do more these are adorable 
2658,leagueoflegends,im gon na have to wait a while for yas and zed right 
2659,leagueoflegends,i personally like playing quinn better but graves is definitely better right now quinn has a lot of roaming potential post 6 and can really snowball graves has more potential in lane and provides a lot of damage 
2660,leagueoflegends,love your comics man  cant wait for the brand one
2661,leagueoflegends,gave me some quick chuckles  thanks for sharing 
2662,leagueoflegends,hey dude  nice thread mind doing tristana ulting away rumble s love advanced

2668,leagueoflegends, this will be useful at least a handful of times     <URL> 
2669,leagueoflegends,this is why i hate the league community it attracts so many addicts because like a drug  it s an escape from reality and like a drug it s craved by addicts 
2670,leagueoflegends,i have literally no brain but i still want to win  malphite i have about 10  of a brain  poppy i have about 50  of a brain  fiora i am duo with adci only play support how do i cs   lulu i wanted mid  lissandra i am smurfingi want to make melee top suicidal  quinn i miss playing riven  irelia i want to be strong in lane but no mechanical skill  renekton i want to solo kill enemy lane and carry teamfight  wukong i want to solo kill enemy lane and 1v9 rest of game  olaf mute all  heimerdinger i want to win lane but lose game after 20  pantheon i want to lose lane and game  yasuo stop getting caught   tryndamere mid open   jin i love memes xdxdxd        i am a girl  teemo gank my lane or i go afk   riven if you gank my lane i go afk   nasus i m bronze 4   illaoi as you can see you have a lot of different choices  just choose whichever one you think sounds more like you 
2671,leagueoflegends,malphite i m an awful top laner but i can play malphite you just have to be able to ult when the other team is grouped together tp plays look like you are pro because you tp and press r it is so brainless and i love it 
2672,leagueoflegends,i recently got into playing the game again dynamic queue takes a lot of the pressure i used to feel off because i always get one of the two roles i can play competently  yeah there are still some assholes but for the most part people seem better behaved these days now instead of lol making me frustrated  it is actually fun and relieves frustration  making a play feels so good i had an adc that i was supporting the other day call me the  best thresh eu  in the post game screen we were only playing a normal so i know they were exaggerating but it felt good

2678,leagueoflegends,next level spaghetti
2679,leagueoflegends,these are so fun and entertaining    
2680,leagueoflegends,true but here are some words by me who used to  believe  this game actually  helps  me    do nt get too comfortable   you ll see these words differently one day 
2681,leagueoflegends,came to see rammus lore was not disappointed
2682,leagueoflegends,gt  lulu spent most of her time wandering alone in the forest  where she found pix and went with it at the glade  the enchanted home of fae there  she lost track of the time  so her return to bandle city was nt appreciated well  that s one way to put it
2683,leagueoflegends,i now realize the irony of maining warwick in the jungle  and soraka at support 
2684,leagueoflegends,that yorick art looked pretty badass

2688,leagueoflegends,lol
2689,leagueoflegends,it is very strange that one or two small changes to kogmaw turn him from one of the worse adc s in high elo  to one of the most insanely strong champions at high elo  just waiting for kog and lulu to be 100  pickban rate next week 
2690,leagueoflegends,kogmaw is now the laptop gun from perfect dark 
2691,leagueoflegends,that olaf thought kogmaw died and went for poppy lol 
2692,leagueoflegends,i never got what was wrong with the old kogmaw to deserve a rework  i think it was way a better designed champion before the rework 
2693,leagueoflegends,he s going so fast one might think he just stands still auto attacking 
2694,leagueoflegends,totally outplayed
2695,leagueoflegends,sentry deployed
2696,leagueoflegends,every time i watch these kog clips he only ever has ragebladerunnans 
2697,leagueoflegends,so i always get insta cced  interrupted and whatever  and in challenger you can literally just stand there for 5 seconds with a lee sin  ahri charm  janna qr and noone uses any cc gg wp
2698,leagueoflegends,only if olaf did nt turn around to get to poppy mid fight 
2699,leagueoflegends,the heal bait baby the fkn dream
2700,leagueoflegends,at least its better than fucking middle of nowhere tallahassee  fl 
2701,leagueoflegends,i m still curious as of why koggy is nt picked anymore i mean  nunu and lulu are still a thing  and with janna as support  all you need is a tanky top with decent ccdamage  kinda tough to put them all together in a viable champion  
2702,leagueoflegends,stop it regi promoting ur business onr eddit
2703,leagueoflegends, interesting   ezreal
2704,leagueoflegends,this makes me extremely happy
2705,leagueoflegends,lol lore remember when there was a league of legends and one day riot decided nah
2706,leagueoflegends,tl  dr  mysterious past
2707,leagueoflegends,small correction  lissandra is actually the last of the iceborn  not an actual watcher the watchers were the tall eerie  mysterious  creatures that turned humans into iceborn iceborn were basically superpowered humans who were made immortal just a small detail 
2708,leagueoflegends,i m ready for rox tigers to brush the dust off their old invention 
2709,leagueoflegends,i thought the actual league of legends and summoners were gone and the lore is just the champion as they are without any tie into why we are playing as them 
2710,leagueoflegends,tl  dr of the tl  dr  129 champions have dark and mysterious pasts 
2711,leagueoflegends,insane mechanix m<SMILE>
2712,leagueoflegends,i really appreciate the effort  but most of these miss major points 
2713,leagueoflegends,fapfapfapfap
2714,leagueoflegends,the amumu one is a little lacking  him waking up in the pyramid not knowing   anything   about himself or where he came from is a pretty big part of it
2715,leagueoflegends,balanced
2716,leagueoflegends,aw  did they remove the part of irelia s lore that the body in the game is just a dummy and irelia s soul is bound in the weapons floating around it after she died 
2717,leagueoflegends,uh vayne killed her parents  i thought it was the dark entity or whatever
2718,leagueoflegends,god bless you
2719,leagueoflegends,damn how many mousepads did they give you for this good job 
2720,leagueoflegends,akali s the  fist  of shadow  not the  first   outside of that it s     faceok 
2721,leagueoflegends,half of the lore is already tl  dr
2722,leagueoflegends,whenever i m in stress i can always turn to playing league it puts all my stress behind me momentarily 
2723,leagueoflegends,i thought chogath was supposed to just be a constantly devouring beast that would eventually consume everythingbut the league is keeping him distracted 
2724,leagueoflegends,sirnukes is a classic example of his trope
2725,leagueoflegends,gt   if you are like me  you are too lazy to read all of the 129 champion lores  credibility of your knowledge of lore is shaky if you have nt read them 
2726,leagueoflegends,urgot s should have been  urgot has a dark and secret past 
2727,leagueoflegends, the legend of ryu continues     <URL> 
2728,leagueoflegends,  <URL>  v  ntlnhndojvm vi uses ulti but tahm eats her as she goes to activate and it causes her to delay for a while then go in 
2729,leagueoflegends,just want to point out that  summoners  are not canon anymore so champions like jax  lee or fiddle have no lore at the moment riot just did nt put the time into clearing it 
2730,leagueoflegends,do nt start building components or you re fucked
2731,leagueoflegends,aww  how will i win games in soloq now   my team always thinks it s god damn magic that one of the lanes is pushed clear up to inhib turrets the entire game 
2732,leagueoflegends,ohmwrecker poppy vs shen top let s just say nowhere was safe 
2733,leagueoflegends,already started building it when i realized it im sad lol
2734,leagueoflegends,man  old kog was so fun and still hypercarried anyways whys it got ta be like this rito 
2735,leagueoflegends,selfie did great job i hope we will see him on the scene soon  
2736,leagueoflegends,and he s no longer a free agent in my fantasy league since i switched him for selfie i thought our league had a gentlemen s agreement on this shit 
2737,leagueoflegends,what was janna doing lol
2738,leagueoflegends,rip trick2g
2739,leagueoflegends,can riot please just go ahead and keep it disabled  like  forever 
2740,leagueoflegends,i also love playing lol when i feel sick i m too focused on that fucking udyr to remember i m in pain
2741,leagueoflegends,but r u going to play civ
2742,leagueoflegends,they really need to let us know is disabled  i also was starting building it on a ranked game and i lost 
2743,leagueoflegends,welp there goes heim mid 
2744,leagueoflegends,tried dota 2 could not end a single cm match without someone leaving or afking so  i came back 
2745,leagueoflegends,it would be nice if they would put it in the client somewhere outside of the shop so people actually realize 
2746,leagueoflegends,did zzrot get a huge buff  why is it so meta suddenly
2747,leagueoflegends,i do nt think i ve ever even played varus  but that arctic ops skin may be hard to pass up 
2748,leagueoflegends,i think i m in love with your girlfriend  bro 
2749,leagueoflegends,pretty sure it s because you could put one under a tower and it would take and keep tower aggro no matter what until it died  3 shots   making for easy tower dives if you re coordinated    <URL>
2750,leagueoflegends,i wish i had this attitude still whenever i take breaks from the game i get way crankier the next time i play 
2751,leagueoflegends,do nt even want to play the game since all i play now is singed  the item is practically core now
2752,leagueoflegends,no team2g tonight i guess    sorry sirhcez   haha
2753,leagueoflegends,gatez
2754,leagueoflegends,psa  ohmwrecker udyr is fine too
2755,leagueoflegends,sorry  but you do nt write well at all makes it a chore to try to comprehend your sentences 
2756,leagueoflegends,i can give u a tl  dr for all of them yes u guessed it right dark and mysterious past
2757,leagueoflegends,back again 
2758,leagueoflegends,actually it was pretty sad to see cw trying to deny resources from werlyb to put wickd ahead and see how he still does shit  the 2nd game was just a very wp game by huma  i would love to see welyb  godbro and santorin in lcs but that will be hard  millenium is pretty good even if they lost today and inspire are so good too 
2759,leagueoflegends,thats one of the reasons i always liked playing this game solo over playing it with teammates i love the being challanged by random people that are trying their best to win the game as well and the challange of building a team in this short time with the 4 randoms in your team it gets me over and over again
2760,leagueoflegends, attractive design       
2761,leagueoflegends,since patch 62 the client freezes when i m in the dynamicq selection i m losing lp for free pls i do nt know what to do to solve this i have windows 10 
2762,leagueoflegends,same just happened to me
2763,leagueoflegends,i always like daydream hopefully he can regain form and be given freedom to play jungle his own way
2764,leagueoflegends,jhin should nt have to reload or use his crit shot on structures the crit damage does nt apply anyways 
2765,leagueoflegends,does anyone know exactly when ghost and bdd will get permission to play  i think it s something to do with age restriction  but does anyone precisely if they will be on the roster for the summer split 
2766,leagueoflegends,katarina who wouldve expected that 
2767,leagueoflegends,lol wtf if anything  league just amplifies my frustrations in life 
2768,leagueoflegends,gt  and feel important  feel powerful  and feel the achievement you sometimes cant in the real world  but you can  you probably just put more time into your league self than into your actual self to see the difference 
2769,leagueoflegends,i am so happy ryu is back even if h2k will play vs vit it could be a great game 
2770,leagueoflegends,i enjoy playing league and i like the game  and im glad that you have this outlook for your own sake  but i cant say i agree or see it that way myself  definitely hasnt gotten me through some hard times  its gotten better this season so far  heres hoping   but trolling  afking  won one of my promo games because their jungler afked  felt sorta shitty  and stuff like that doesnt make me feel better about my life or my problems  usually just makes them worse  but everyone is different

2856,leagueoflegends,tips on playing trydamere  i really like him so i ve been trying to get good with him i do nt know if i should build for pure damage  or get some defense should i try to 1v1 people  or should i pick off people in team fights  on my second week of playing 
2857,leagueoflegends,tl  dr video games
2858,leagueoflegends,i love league my dedication to climbing was so that my games would be featured and people could see my ign i purposely made my ign into a funny one so that people can see it and laugh  but the featured games only features normals and arams right now so
2859,leagueoflegends,i like that league can help you bond with each other while in skype calls
2860,leagueoflegends,relevant flair
2861,leagueoflegends,hm so they wanted kc to actually learn the game  yeah his speech before each match  talking about the game  was very odd 
2862,leagueoflegends,the reason i love lol  i will never cure my alcoholism because i need a drink after every ranked game 
2863,leagueoflegends,seems like you have had a good day on the rift
2864,leagueoflegends,the thing i loved most about lol was queuing up with friends and then do the most random shit  blitz shaco botlane cheese  tp to the side brush inbetween turrets before the other team gets there and then ambush them  without that the rest of the team cares season 1season 2 were the best times for me when it comes to pure fun but the seasons after that made me a better player 
2865,leagueoflegends, d
2866,leagueoflegends,op is a true casual all these salty plebs are mad they ca nt climb the ladder lol
2867,leagueoflegends,can someone look at my match history and tell me why i ca nt seem to climb  i m stuck in bronzesilver forever  i ve been doing good in most matches and sometimes j get pretty fed and still lose  i do nt know what i m doing wrong  need some help  so i have 90  of the champions and do nt stick to one or two champions  instead i play jungle mostly around 15 different ones  5 ones that i play more because i m a bit better on those yes i do buy pink wards  one on each back and sometimes i end up buying too many pink wards as in there s already one on the map in a good spot now what do i do with the one in my inv  i do tend to get toxic but only when and if and only if someone else is toxic to me first  which i m working on fixing  my ign is  guthixmage 
2868,leagueoflegends,holy shit thoorins comment on crumbz  nidalee was brutal  ren was up 6k  crumbz gave them a gift by playing a nidalee which was one of the worst competitive nidalee games that we could ever see for jungle  probably true though edit  happened around 2  40
2869,leagueoflegends,i do nt like how he jumps to conclusion on players like sven or yellowstar and trying to force some narrative that they were always like they are now at tsm i would think it s something he would call  fanlogic  
2870,leagueoflegends,knew it was probably kat  ironic since shes probably one of the most archetypal and uninspired characters in league though most characters in league s early existence are generic fantasy archetypes
2871,leagueoflegends,i ve always used gaming as an escape of sorts for my problems in life some of the people you meet online make thimgs better  and make you feel like you are nt alone the feeling of just being decent at something and being knowledgeable helps me feel like i at least i can do something better than most people as i sink myself deeper into the game grinding lp every tier feeling like an <URL> and an even bigger deal when my life feel stagnant or like things are nt in my control  and seeing people do the same as you and talk to them and help them on their lives as an outlet to talk to is a great feeling for me as well the other day i was talking to a guy who started telling me about his coke addiction how he feels about life and he just sorta vented to me it felt good being able to add my inputs and try and make things seem a little better  life sucks sometimes league is always here for me as sad as it may sound to some people 
2872,leagueoflegends,reminds me of the time back when they lost their lcs spot cause of base race   
2873,leagueoflegends,ah i love the ryu stories glad he is back but i think selfie should be thanked he held the spot down pretty well and did what he had to do 
2874,leagueoflegends,it s over for them
2875,leagueoflegends,while i know ryu will do well on a personal level  i m still a little worried how well he will do when he actually starts working with the rest of the team 
2876,leagueoflegends,_____
2877,leagueoflegends,rip eune super team
2878,leagueoflegends,now we just need edward and diamond   go go germany   
2879,leagueoflegends,return of the dragon 
2880,leagueoflegends,he  s back  after a hellish few weeks of visa issues  ryu will be returning to the midlane this thursday   due to the syrian refugee crisis in germany  obtaining working visas has proved to be a particularly difficult and lengthy process while possible shortcuts were available and <URL> to us  we believe that we have taken the only legally appropriate route to sorting out a proper working visa for ryu   richard wells though it  s been very tough without ryu  the team still managed to go 51 without him  thanks to the presence of echo fox midlaner selfie  stepping in everyone at h2k would like to thank marcin for his time with the team we greatly appreciate his services in this tough time and we hope the journey was a worthwhile experience for him as he heads back to his parent organisation  we would also like to again thank rick fox  khalid jones and everyone else at the echo fox organisation for being so generous and cooperative during this tough time  we now look forward to this week  s matches as we take on vitality and origen   h2kwin
2881,leagueoflegends,h 2 what   
2882,leagueoflegends,well of course  sfv just came out today
2883,leagueoflegends,this is the guy who came up with the h2k team chant 
2884,leagueoflegends,finally i can put him back in my fantasy my team has been suffering
2885,leagueoflegends,i missed my boy  glad to see the legendary shotcaller and team fighter return  
2886,leagueoflegends,i m glad the boss is back  gt 
2887,leagueoflegends,finally h2k can continue to develop  i was seriously scared for a while there that it would be another unlucky run for forg1ven  hope i did nt jinx it 
2888,leagueoflegends,finally the midlane god  best western player of all the time  the guy who solokilled the overrated asian nerd  faker  will have some competition 
2889,leagueoflegends,ryu looks like hes out of shape to be fighting ken right now 
2890,leagueoflegends,ok  so now the real spring split may start 
2891,leagueoflegends,was it really reginald
2892,leagueoflegends,finally  super good news for h2k
2893,leagueoflegends,glad to hear that  <URL> back ryu 
2894,leagueoflegends,<URL> back ryu   
2895,leagueoflegends,hopefully selfie goes to renegades or something yeah the team is utter garbage but itd be better than being on the bench
2896,leagueoflegends,ryu with visa _ ryu without visa _ also  rip selfie you did well mate 
2897,leagueoflegends,what a stupid post 
2898,leagueoflegends,play rammus boom the armored turtle is in a great spot right now as ad champs are <URL> more popular and powerful  rengar stealthing in to kill your carry  powerball on top of your adc and make that kitty combo himself into a knockup and then killing himself on your thornmail  zed trying to deathmark something  no big deal  2 seconds of attacking your face is plenty of time to kill him  and shadows do nt really hurt turtles anyway his shurikens will bounce right off your shell  yasuo split pushing and right clicking things  yelling about the wind and being annoying   duel  him by pushing w and then e and watching while he crits himself to death you can even let him ult you first i find yasuos <URL> very confused if they right click something and it does nt immediately die  you are also great against riven  fiora  talon  jax  tryndamere  and master yi you are even helpful against ap assassins like fizz  katarina  or nidalee watching katarina start her death lotus  only to immediately turn and auto attack you  is a very satisfying feeling  this new item is great for adcs  and ad assassins  but a surefire to ruin their day is to make them blow their load on a 45k hp 450 armor rammus  source  i play rammus every day 
2899,leagueoflegends,also taric is a decentish support  with enough stacked armor  even with their ad pen  your carries will be too tanky to be bursted easily 
2900,leagueoflegends,he s an armadillo is nt his title  the armordillo 
2901,leagueoflegends,i mean its less that people cant figure out that tanks are a good counter to assasins it more a combination of a lot of people dont like playing tanks but also people dont want the tank meta to come back 
2902,leagueoflegends,gt  yasuo split pushing and right clicking things  yelling about the wind and being annoying   duel  him by pushing w and then e and watching while he crits himself to death you can even let him ult you first i find yasuos <URL> very confused if they right click something and it does nt immediately die  sold
2903,leagueoflegends,had a game with rammus on our team  enemy kog died to thornmaildefensive curl
2904,leagueoflegends, ok 
2905,leagueoflegends,i actually played vs rammus top as a few assassin and it s completely unfair  even if u kill him early on he will just slowly but surely build and stack a million armor and outscale u and all u can do is watch as he dive s you full hp under your turret  
2906,leagueoflegends,if after this selfie wo nt play atleast 23 matches in echo fox then i feel like he should leave them and look for other offer 
2907,leagueoflegends,shyvana actually has 2 artwork appearances   <URL>   <URL>
2908,leagueoflegends,welpwe know what is nt going to get played in lcs this week
2909,leagueoflegends,iwci in mexico city   when brazil is going to have a tornament 
2910,leagueoflegends, youtube     <URL>  v  92qhllx94zwamp  feature  youtube 
2911,leagueoflegends, mfw ryu is back     <URL> 
2912,leagueoflegends,you re right op  i wonder why people even waste their time with other champions when rammus is clearly the best pick 
2913,leagueoflegends,that tilted me and i was on the winning team  hairyabs 
2914,leagueoflegends,most inconvenient reload time to date
2915,leagueoflegends,it hurts too much to watch
2916,leagueoflegends,i m so salty i live close to chicago and i will be moving to shanghai in like 6 months so i m gon na miss worlds and msi 
2917,leagueoflegends,aside from every assassin being able to buy something called a qss  full lifesteal sated yi shits on rammus 
2918,leagueoflegends,no  against assasins i prefer to instalock my riven  im pretty good at her have masterylv5 and 2skins that can vouch for my mechonics  only 29  wr because team holding me back gg
2919,leagueoflegends,tldr  did nt transition from his background to the esports scene as fast as tsm neededexpected him to his methods seemed good on paper but failed in execution with the players they have suitable replacements in mind 
2920,leagueoflegends,ok 
2921,leagueoflegends,turtle    turtle    he s an armordillo you son of a
2922,leagueoflegends,the best post in a while holy shit not only did you give useful information  you also made it very funny and made my day take my upvote 
2923,leagueoflegends,rammus lulu is a great combo too
2924,leagueoflegends,gt  i find yasuos <URL> very confused if they right click something and it does nt immediately die  this is so perfect
2925,leagueoflegends, youtube mirror     <URL>  v  b<SMILE>3aljpydsg     boop beep  i ve made peace with my master it was all a misunderstanding sorry brakeline
2926,leagueoflegends,i play rammus in ranked as well he is carying me out of bronze
2927,leagueoflegends,lol watching jhin mess with his gun with the nexus at 10 hp
2928,leagueoflegends,assassins got you angry  play anti assassin champions  i wonder how this subreddit has nt already come to that conclusion
2929,leagueoflegends,pay for coach chris job done 
2930,leagueoflegends,was playing draven rammus flies into me at mach 10 speeds with cinderhulk and thornmail taunts me i was at 100  hp i died before the taunt ended and rammus was the only one fighting me 1010 would cry again
2931,leagueoflegends,in before they announce their new life coach el dyrone 
2932,leagueoflegends,pretty much my  1 advice  whenever one of my friends asks  how do i climb  and another friend answers  learn the meta champs   i just tell them  no  learn the meta champ counters  
2933,leagueoflegends,randomly picked rammus a few days ago when i saw the enemies had alot of ad the most ok decision i ever made in champ select 1010  would roll again
2934,leagueoflegends,what if i tell you  assassins can buy last whisper  mawqss and a lifesteal item and baam rammus  useless
2935,leagueoflegends,cho gath having hp gain with ult  silence  and a knock up makes him really good vs them and good ratios on top of base damages
2936,leagueoflegends,bonus points when you get to see a fed devourer nocturne run in terror from a rammus 3 levels below him  thornmail hurts man  
2937,leagueoflegends,gt  i find yasuos <URL> very confused if they right click something and it does nt immediately die  the last time i played this match up  the yasuo was throwing his wall at my powerball
2938,leagueoflegends,i like to pick bard  just ulting the enemy zed and zhou victim is a very satisfying feeling doubly so if you land the stunlock 
2939,leagueoflegends,deilor confirmed reignover shotcalled the skirmishes while huni shotcalled the teleports  2015 fnc s strength was early skirmish and great teleport to get gold leads through agression  that s why yellowstar is nt that impressive on tsm as a shotcaller 
2940,leagueoflegends,he is not a turtle 
2941,leagueoflegends,people never go for counter picks in solo queue 
2942,leagueoflegends,i do nt understand this is the 2nd place team after 9 games with wins over the two teams tied for 3rd  if this is struggling  i assume thorin thinks tsm should just dominate na lcs but i remember him predicting immortals as 5th or 6th 
2943,leagueoflegends,please rito  if they have a cosplay dance like all star 2013 turn the camera that way and not the desk talking i had to catch up on the vods last time
2944,leagueoflegends,next season they should start having msi in the non major regions like brazil turkey or australia 
2945,leagueoflegends,it s harder to understand lol pro players without knowing lol 
2946,leagueoflegends,i really do nt feel like you can just plug and play coaches coaching is a process that requires respect from the players 
2947,leagueoflegends,this is starting to <URL> laughable at best  downright dumbfounding at a frequent pace  tsm needs to find another reginald someone with the same level of command for respect and attention sure regi was a good player in his day so at some level that plays a role in what he is able to <URL> when he is around the team  but honestly you just need someone that wont cut corners or try to foster positive vibes with these kids  fuck all of the lets be homies bullshit and kumbaya ass seminars for character growth hire someone for that role and dont call them a coach this specific set of players consist of a jungler that knows he can carry  a mid laner that knows he can 2v<SMILE> in na at any given time  an adc that knows that his mechanics are at all times in the top 1  of pro league  a top laner that has a chip on his shoulder to prove he s not just  tsm s top laner   despite being the most consistent on the team thus far  and a support that knows he can orchestrate the team efficiently in midlate game  all you need is a fucking hype man someone that will boost their egos when its called for a bully someone that will shit on them and call them out when they are fucking up the team s flow leave jarge as the strategic coach he s goodsolid filler for plugging in the information and direction this team needs when they themselves get in the way of their own skill parth is a great analyst he feeds them matchup intell and scouting reports or whatever the fuck he does  if you hadnt realized by now im going off of just a blanketed assumption of what these guys contribute to the team   this team needs someone that will agressively exude passion and harshly inflict criticism there isnt a personality on this team from what i know that will crumble from some assertive alpha male kc had the right idea about being the dominant force on the team but it turned out that he couldnt mark his territory i assume  telling this group of guys to  fake the funk  after barely beating some shitters  yes  im calling echo fox shitters in this context because despite their pr and pc bullshit tsm wanted to say it themselves  was probably the icing on the cake attempting to further neuter some wounded dire wolves like they no doubt feel they are is grounds for being thrown to the wall you need someone to come in after a game saying  god damn bjerg murder that fucking mid lane some more    or  who called for that last baron  you know you absolutely fucked us right  but you did manage good vision pathing for the set up so just   tsm is the ultimate  i am a fucking legend  team its in the fucking name this team is meant to individually shit on the enemy for the sake of the team yes the meta doesnt fit their traditional playstyle of bodying bitches with raw skill  or funneling resources into the carry  but at the absolute apex of what this team represents  its swagger  arrogance  and the pursuit of  1v1mebro  
2948,leagueoflegends,tl  dr  kc does not league hard enough  is nt on the same page as players thus life coaching makes no sense
2949,leagueoflegends,what kind of progress were they expecting  did they think he would help them change in 23 months 
2950,leagueoflegends,so glad that ryus back when we are against an inform vitality
2951,leagueoflegends,just in case the website goes down gt  tsm coach changes kc was released yesterday on february 15th in the evening initially  we brought him on with the expectation that he would be the  life coach  or  out of game coach   his duties as a life coach was to help players maintain healthy relationships amongst each other  with their own lives  and to help them maintain a competitive mindset throughout the season at the beginning  we felt that he had a lot of great ideas regarding how to achieve this  and his background in traditional sports seemed to be a solid fit  gt  we wanted to keep kc on and try to work with him through the situations that arose  but he was unable to progress at a rate where he could <URL> the coach we needed given our limited time he was unable to transition his background into the esports scene  causing a lack of understanding between him and the players while his methods may have been effective in a traditional sports setting  it was ineffective for our team  gt  with this being said  we would like to thank kc for his efforts and time with us we wish him good luck on his future endeavors currently  we have several candidates in mind as a suitable replacement in his position  and we will give an update as soon as it is available 
2952,leagueoflegends,i love the fact that its double round robin 
2953,leagueoflegends,lol  you sound like a dude i just played with as soon as the enemy team picked yi  he just says  someone play rammus 
2954,leagueoflegends,what happened to my man taric 
2955,leagueoflegends,okay  so i recently picked up lol again after being almost entirely inactive for about 23 years when i saw the title of this post  my eyes went all wide and mouth agape  i   seriously   had forgotten yorick even existed just seeing his name completely blew my mind 
2956,leagueoflegends,  <URL>
2957,leagueoflegends,enemy s affected by the slow could have a little black hole above their head  o
2958,leagueoflegends,eternum is reserved to the biomech skinline tho
2959,leagueoflegends,a rammus is nt going to stop an akali from 2 shotting your adc 
2960,leagueoflegends,i think that one thing people seem to forget is the tsm culture we always talk about how regi commands the room when he talks  and sure that is a personality thing  but one thing that people forget is that regi is the boss  the head of tsm kc is the head coach  but it seems like it was never really established that he is the head coach the same happened with locodoco when regi stepped in  and when that takes place  the coach will automatically lose power in the team it s hard to know what kc really did for the team  but it seems like in tsm s culture  with such strong personalities  it would be pretty difficult for kc or anyone  without esports background  to command any kind of respect just my two cents 
2961,leagueoflegends,thorin is super knowledgeable and hits some really good points sometimes i seriously think someone could make a living making tl  dr youtube videos of  thorin s thoughts   and the rest of his vids  using his key points 
2962,leagueoflegends,i do nt know  i get tired of hearing the oh who has tsm actually beat  and their 73 is watered down  cmon sure they have been inconsistent  which pretty much can be tagged on every team outside of rox tigers and immortals currently  but please  they beat c9 and clg and arguably gave immortals one of their biggest challenges as well  that  while it may not be living up to the on paper hype  is still pretty darn good 
2963,leagueoflegends,when did corylulu switch to h2k flair  p
2964,leagueoflegends,seems awfully easy to ream a guy after he s already been fired and be like  i always knew he was garbage  i agree with him on the shotcalling though if people are nt listening to yellowstar the solution is nt too have everyone shotcall just tell dlift and bjergsen to shut up and let him do his thing
2965,leagueoflegends,he is correct in saying some of he things he has the woodbuck comments were not justified and based on speculation and filling in narrative but the general team analysis was good tsm is struggling with their team synergy and that is because the roles of each player are not yet fully defined this is evident in the tsm legends videos and the players continually saying so   we are nt clicking   trying to find my place   we are nt on the same page  etc paraphrasing   their last game vs clg we saw a pretty good improvement from past weeks the jgsup roam was good and the grouping to skirmish or take objectives was also improved but you can see it multiple times where yellowstar probably called for something  engage and have his team follow up a split second too late  not entirely as crisp as it should have been for a super team    he does make a very good point in what yellowstar bring to the team if you do nt let him shotcall and control the macro game  why bring him in at all  that is his strength it will take time in the end i feel as if bjersen is still trying to make calls from old habits  he was the leader of 20142015 tsm  he made that team work he is learning to let the reigns go and trust in yellowstar and the new tsm hierarchy  i also think that svenskeren looks bad because of the lack of cohesion not 100  on individual play he can play aggressive but needs his team to back him up  he is a great jungler he does nt necessarily have to play a supportive role either  look at peanut for the rox tigers  he plays ultra aggressive and does nt need to invest heavily into wards  he is a ward he tracks the enemy jg by constantly invading and controlling the enemy his team is also willing to invade and skirmish with him svenskeren has the ability to do the same thing and so does the team tsm just needs to be willing to play around that  ys roams  dl plays safer and willing to lose farm  bjerg controlling the opposing mid  and hauntzer controlling the opposing top laner  more factors but you get the point probably   obviously more time is needed to really see if this team is world class 
2966,leagueoflegends,i feel like tsm took the their strat of  berj solo carry the team  from last season and thought  lets get some more players that can solo carry a game since the berj plan worked out well enough  so now they have three solo carries a leader no one listens to and a team player  who looks like the person doing the best on the team 
2967,leagueoflegends,was nt mundo part of the cinematic promotingadvertising the launch of the mac client amp  the iblitzcrank skin  and damn  caitlyn is so low i feel like she s more iconic than most of the champions up to the 67th places 
2968,leagueoflegends,this is why  generally speaking  teams  in traditional sports  pickfind a coach and have the coach build the team in the usual case of a team already existing  they let the coach make roster decisions if the coach handpicks the players  you have someone to goto when things are nt working out because of the simple fact that the coach built the team not every coach will work well with certain players and obviously  tsm was nt going to let kc get rid ofreplace players on their team it can be difficult to fit in a coach that works with such strong personalities that are in tsm hopefully tsm can find a new coach before katowice and all the best to kc 
2969,leagueoflegends,could you do one for high noon jhin  if you can

2973,leagueoflegends,if you re in division 5 of silver or gold  can you get demoted from too many losses  iirc several seasons ago it was impossible to get demoted from division 5 but i ca nt remember if they changed that 
2974,leagueoflegends,the tsm guides by actual tsm members had always sucked have they got any better or are they just item and mastery builds like they have been for years 
2975,leagueoflegends,after having looked over these  featured guides  from tsm players i feel i can confidently say they have been written by the same person if that person was a tsm pro or not i ca nt say  although i find it unlikely 
2976,leagueoflegends,pretty good guides
2977,leagueoflegends,where can i get my plat teemo guide from trm 
2978,leagueoflegends,aaaaaand it s down  
2979,leagueoflegends,big improvement ui wise  still see a lot of room for improvement 710
2980,leagueoflegends,i was on the site the other day and saw a rainman teemo guide miss that guy
2981,leagueoflegends,tsm need to step up their meme game  tryhards 
2982,leagueoflegends,lets hope h2k was doing the same thing fox did and were still practicing with him
2983,leagueoflegends,dodoes it know it s an ad 
2984,leagueoflegends,this is another reason why tsm players get paid a lot they work hard
2985,leagueoflegends,really good piece  though i think he is reading way to much into what is essentially an extremely small and specifically chosen data pool  reddit comments  calling someone out on using buzzwords when he is essentially applying for the job on riot  and a reality show where pretty much all strategic coaching parts ar nt shown  for good reason   secondly  he says that skt amp  fnatic had only 1 central shotcaller  this is just blatently not true as has been said by skt when marin left and by fnatic in one of their recent episodes 
2986,leagueoflegends,what about probuildsnet 
2987,leagueoflegends,buy a steraks gage  it literally cock blocks any burst champion if you re a squishy champion that deals dmg
2988,leagueoflegends,when you get sick of sr  spam aram it will help you learn teamfights and champs  disable all chat  mute all is better than tilt 
2989,leagueoflegends,pls no top rammus  
2990,leagueoflegends,millenium already qualified so they decided to hold a clown fiesta in celebration of reaching the playoffs  do nt worry guys  they ll be back next week 
2991,leagueoflegends,nice 
2992,leagueoflegends,i think i know this lb irl  he s playing on a 3500 ping  with 2 eyepatches and parkinson  
2993,leagueoflegends,go afk i can 1v5
2994,leagueoflegends,wait that s not sneaky
2995,leagueoflegends,i am sure the api code will help make the league community a better place 
2996,leagueoflegends,where can i get a girl like that 
2997,leagueoflegends,founs this funny and felt pity for yorick went into a game got yorick in the enemy team that guy is fu   ing overpowered and has no counterplay
2998,leagueoflegends,i think for sure one of the key points thorin makes is that  super teams  are never considered such at their inception even started studded rosters like s5 koo tigers  edg  and the original alliance had players who were not considered the best at their role  but went on to <URL> fantastic teams 
2999,leagueoflegends,tbh get darius as much as i hate to admit it  the guy s pretty good in any meta he s been thrown at
3000,pokemon,love the shading on the colored ones 
3001,pokemon,reminds me of ash s goodra     why  
3002,pokemon,the hair looks like moms from futurama love your work 
3003,pokemon,ultragod
3004,pokemon,apricorns to make pokeballs and walking with your pokemon 
3005,pokemon,hold up ash is a squirrel ash s mom is a deer i m no biologist  but i do nt think that s how that works 
3006,pokemon,lmfao sooooo cute
3007,pokemon,i love this style  and great colours 
3008,pokemon,it really is nt a feature i miss  but a gameplay aspect i m starting to notice  i miss how gym leaders could use a different number of pok  mon ever since black and white came out  the first two gym leaders use 2 pok  mon while the rest of them use 3 the other regions had some variety  in kanto for example  brock and misty use 2  lt surge uses 3 or 1 depending on the version  erika  sabrina  and blaine use 3  koga uses 4  and giovanni uses 5   elite four using 4 pok  mon is also something i do nt like i know oras is nt guilty of this but i think z will  i also miss the level variations the gym leaders  elite four  champion  and other bosses had i m sure many have noticed how the lead pok  mon is at the same level as every other pok  mon that the boss uses except for the ace  the lead pok  mon is always 2 levels less than the ace   it s just making the games a bit more predictable 
3009,pokemon,both 2nd map  and the dressup feature from xy i know dressup is hilariously minor  and it wo nt make or break a game for me  but i always get a little excited about customizing my trainer and i love collecting things 
3010,pokemon,copied this from posts in another thread  the gb sounds key item from hgss
3011,pokemon,i miss the old exp share
3012,pokemon,what everyone else said about walking with pokemon and join avenue plus the ability to change clothes and face
3013,pokemon,using apricorns to make pokeballs
3014,pokemon,nights  seasons  weekdays  being able to visit a second region
3015,pokemon, the only one i have got stored on my pc  i d love to find a new wallpaper since my current one sucks     pre12deviantartnetdbbathpref2015213<SMILE>cpokemon_xy_full_hd_wallpaper_by_pokeminer9<SMILE>d93pdb0jpg  for anyone wondering this is my current  one     <URL>  it s good but i d love a better one
3016,pokemon,nice job makes me nostalgic that s my childhood right there 
3017,pokemon,as i went back and played some of the older games  i remembered some of cool features that never came out in the other games this made me want to know what past features people want to bring back for me  it s the change of music and comments from your opponent during battles in the 4th and 5th gens it made battles seem more active  with more intense music if you had a gym leader or e4 member on the ropes or if they had you on the ropes their comments during battle also was something cool because it let you see what they were feeling as the battle progressed so  what feature would you guys like to bring back 
3018,pokemon,these are just google images i looked at and drew with cheap office pens i do nt draw much but i always enjoy it whenever i do
3019,pokemon,xpost referenced from rbeadsprites by ucolinw0<SMILE>05  eeveelutions      <URL>         i   am   a   bot   made   for   your   convenience     especially   for   mobile   users      contact     <URL>  to  originalpostsearcher        code     <URL>        faq     <URL>  faq 
3020,pokemon,xpost referenced from rcrossstitch by ustitchmond  i ca nt stop with the pop art      <URL>         i   am   a   bot   made   for   your   convenience     especially   for   mobile   users      contact     <URL>  to  originalpostsearcher        code     <URL>        faq     <URL>  faq 
3021,pokemon,i thought about it  and for me one of the most fun aspects of a pok  mon game is discovering the pokemons in the wild  which routes they are on  and how many are they in the region i completed my dex on y and or  and when you go through all the hard work you just want to never do it again  but when you get that fresh new game  if you transfer your complete dex  it just feels less rewarding you know where to find all poke mons and you do nt have the drive to  catch them all  because they are already registered  so  in my opinion  it is a bad idea to transfer the dex  also  it would nt make sense for the story  since each character is different from regions  the player is the same so how do you explain a professor asking you to fill out the national dex but saying  hey  we already have someone that completed it in another region  we really do nt need your services  goodbye  and your pokemon journey ends right there 
3022,pokemon,so the one thing that s stopped me from going all the way with completing a national pokedex is that when a new generation is released  it s back to square one  sure you can use pokemon bank to transfers mons across  but this is time consuming and in order to maintain a complete dex you ll still need to be in possession of every evolution stage  what do you guys think about having the option to transfer pokedex completion to the next game  what would be some possible implications  restrictions etc to make it fair  do you think it s a bad idea in general  if so why 
3023,pokemon,would would they fight using humans 
3024,pokemon,protean on the froakie line is one of the most valuable has because of it s usefulness 
3025,pokemon,ha cradily  and the other fossils  were a pain in the ass to get also the sinnoh starters are hard to find imo 
3026,pokemon,right now i m looking for an immunity gligar that s impossible to find
3027,pokemon,i actually find completing the pok  dex fun  3 the only mons i transfer from an old game to a new game are my legendary collection and battleready pkmn but i ll only do that after i m done with the story  3
3028,pokemon, 200 dollars  not even  20 i m waaay too cheap 
3029,pokemon,as fancy as these may be  i d rather just pay  10  for a set on etsy
3030,pokemon,    tahk0       <URL>   gt   20160216 07  41  03 utc     <URL>  gt  here are high quality images of the luxury official gym badges you can buy for almost two hundred bucks    <URL>      <URL>     imgur      <URL>      mistake     <URL>  to  tweetposteramp  subject  error  20reportamp  message  461g3z  0a  0aplease leave above link unaltered     suggestion    <URL>  to  tweetposteramp  subject  suggestion     faq    <URL>     code      <URL>     issues      <URL> 
3031,pokemon,scratch that  you can preorder now for next month 
3032,pokemon,while these look very nice   200 is very steep i realize you re trying to market them as luxury but there s nothing much different with these than other badges available
3033,pokemon,the scariest thing is the price tag
3034,pokemon,i did nt even know this was a thing 
3035,pokemon,i might get some flack for this  but i think the oras soundtrack was really really well done  and if dp were to be remade i d prefer the more rhythmic music of oras
3036,pokemon,i always plan out a team early on and then slowly build it never switching out and by the end of the game battling the elite four is always such a thrill seeing my friends that have battled all the way to this point fighting at their max capability is amazing and then to beat the champion and walk up to the hall of fame very little comes close to that 
3037,pokemon,i never left it honestly
3038,pokemon,i was 9 or 10 when redblue came out i had an original game boy and put so many hours into those games i never played pokemon again though until i bought a ds and platinum back in 2009 that was the last time i played any handheld games since then  my gaming has mostly been halo  destiny  and  most recently  battlefront  last month  when they announced the new pokemon 3ds with redblue  i got super excited i dug through old stuff to find my ds  but i have no idea where it is so i found my sister s old game boy advance and borrowed a copy of firered from a friend  i got hooked again so last week i went ahead and bought a new 3ds xl i could nt wait until the end of february for the new pokemon 3ds  plus i wanted the larger screen i got pokemon x and it s awesome that almost every time i step into tall grass  there s a brand new pokemon i ve never seen before i even convinced my coworker  who also has nt played pokemon since the late 90s  to get a n3dsxl and pokemon y  i ve got 6 badges so far after i beat the elite 4 and progress through some endgame stuff or whatever  i m going to get alpha sapphire i want to try and get that soon so i can compete in the kanto classic tournament next month and get that dragonite 
3039,pokemon,i never really left it on purpose i just went through a rough patch in my life where so much went on because my parents split up and stuff  i did nt even realize a new pokemon game had come out that was when gen 4 started 
3040,pokemon,two and a half years ago  a guy i had barely met but briefly bonded over with about pok  mon  although i had nt played for two years or so  because i did nt like gen 5 very much  and got influenced by my brother who is somewhat of a genwunner  pushed me to go get pok  mon y on day one i did i loved it  now i m more obsessed than ever about pok  mon  and this guy has been my best friend for two years 
3041,pokemon,stopped after i finished alpha sapphire did nt come back until about september of last year was gone for a long while because life got busy and shit starting happening i needed something to make me feel happy after a while of being sad  so i came back to pokemon because i happened to take a glimpse of the anime while scrolling through channels now it s all better  
3042,pokemon, event intended for children  ages 6up parental supervision required at all times all giveaways and event materials available while supplies last and distributed to participating children only limit one per child quantities limited  no rain checks 
3043,pokemon,i got fed up with the new gens  i actually got back into it by a fan made game  pok  mon reborn now i play all the gens and place various challenges on myself  currently doing a gymleader nuzlock of emerald as a dark gymleader 
3044,pokemon,i never left
3045,pokemon,charizard looks sweet here awesome job 
3046,pokemon,quit when anime got shit  black and white came back when anime got better  x and y basically  mega evolutions   
3047,pokemon,the last new pokemon games i had were sapphire amp  leafgreen i stopped keeping up with new games after that because i was going into high school  so my priorities completely changed  plus i did nt have the money to purchase the ds  and would have been too embarrassed to ask for it as a gift   in university i could nt afford to buy a new console either  so i started playing the newer games on emulators i have a job and a lot of free time now  so i spontaneously decided to get a 2ds even though i had other priorities for a while  i did nt totally lose interest  because i still played my gba and gbc pokemon games the entire time what kept me away was lack of cash flow  and i came back because i can now afford it  and i just missed playing new pokemon games 
3048,pokemon,i got a 3ds 
3049,pokemon,hey everyone  i am trying to plan my next lets play and was wondering what everyone thinks is the best pokemon gamerom hack  this could include story  difficulty  or even if you just want to see something new 
3050,pokemon,this is a question for those who abandoned the series or lost interest for a long period of time before going back  maybe you thought you were too old for it  or maybe you just grew tired  or maybe you were nt really attached to it at first  but if you were done with pok  mon and got back  what did bring you back 
3051,pokemon,fire red leaf green ramp  s looked awful to me as a kid 
3052,pokemon,i got a 3ds 
3053,pokemon,i guess i thought i was too old by the time hoenn was new but uh i always still lowkey liked it anime was still on so i knew a few of the new ones but i got bored when i tried my friend s game  i guess it was nostalgia with the remakes in 4th combined with the lore of the 4th and 5th gen games that brought me back 
3054,pokemon,pearl that was when it got serious and i learned about the deeper mechanics of the game 
3055,pokemon,ash grey is pretty good 
3056,pokemon,for me  it was always a money issue  growing up  i bought myself all the games red  blue  yellow  gold  silver  crystal  even ruby and sapphire i loved them to death but then i graduated high school  and went to college college was hard  and after struggling there for four years  i had no job to speak of times were hard  part of me always loved pokemon though always remembered the great times we had growing up after many  many long years of barely scraping by  i moved across the country a few times before settling into my current job it s a very boring job  with lots of dead time so i loaded up a gba emulator on my kindle  popped in emerald  because i had dreams of getting a mew finally   and something clicked again the world i had left changed drastically  and i knew i wanted back in  eventually i discovered a neat little game shop just down the street from my place i met the owner  and we ve <URL> great friends and it s all because i did nt want to shut up about pokemon when he was chatting to one of the other customers about it  now  it s over two years later  i have a 3ds  two ds s  and a copy of every gen v game but w2  and all the gen vi games after nearly twenty damned years   i have my mew   and i am more excited over pokemon than i have ever been  but i think the real reason why i ve come back now is all thanks to oras i m so glad i picked as for my first gen vi title  because it s shown me what an absolutely exciting place that pokemon is right now  and what a wonderful place it s going to continue changing into 
3057,pokemon,light platinum is one of my personal favorites every pokemon up til that point  16 badges  items replacing hms  more field moves etc highly <URL> checking it out 
3058,pokemon,from this sub i mean i think i found b2w2 and oras  but i d like to ses people s reactions again those times seem so far back 
3059,pokemon,garchomp personally  i d make it black and blue  like what they did with tron  do nt lie  that d be fucking awesome 
3060,pokemon,espeon was my favorite pokemon and the first time i got a shiny eevee i was super excited  and then it evolved
3061,pokemon,all of the green ones  green is almost always a terrible  terrible idea 
3062,pokemon,kingler  krabby looks nice all gold  then it evolves into a poop coloured kingler 
3063,pokemon,caught a shiny slowpoke few months back but almost ran it was in a horde  right next to 4 normal slowpoke but i still almost missed it so the shinies that are nt very different are the ones i d change 
3064,pokemon,pretty much any pokemon that s impossible to tell if it s a shiny or not 
3065,pokemon,i just want more black shines and less purple and pink ffs 
3066,pokemon,this was for katsucon  i take it  awesome dress shame the con was so aggressively meh 
3067,pokemon,very clever    this is a brilliant idea and beautiful execution 
3068,pokemon,did he choose you 
3069,pokemon,this is absolutely incredible  i love it  i like how the red hair helps emphasize the tophalf of the pokeball well done 
3070,pokemon,he had better choose you 
3071,pokemon,that is gorgeous 
3072,pokemon,not gon na lie i thought you just bought a redwhite dress and put a circle cardboard cut out in the middle of it 
3073,pokemon,this makes me think of mega gardevoir 
3074,pokemon,omg thats beautiful
3075,pokemon,  _ 
3076,pokemon,i left around the gen 4 era after playing dpp i was in middle school and had played everything up until then i just figured i was getting too old for it i saw the commericals coming out for xy and said screw it honestly  that little ninja frog brought back some amazing memories of playing rby back in in 99  and i ve recently finished black and am starting up black 2 my oldest niece is getting into pokemon as well  and i am buying her a 2ds and gen 6 for her tomorrow  i missed her birthday and thank you taxes   i m 22 and managed to convince a few friends to get back into as well it s been a huge part of my life 
3077,pokemon,nidoqueen they had a really great thing going with the nidoran line having the opposite gender s colours for their shinies  and then they messed it all up by making nidoqueen mostly green and it s not even a nice green  and it clashes with the pink  also nidoran m and nidorino shuld have blue insides of their ears  not brown  for the same reason  it would be neat if shiny golduck was yellow  like shiny psyduck is blue you may be able to tell that i like swapped palettes  shiny rapidash is okay i guess  but i d rather they kept the blue mane that shiny ponyta has instead of changing it to grey  generally  most of the green ones  to be honest  unless the nonshiny version is green as well espeon comes to mind 
3078,pokemon,as others have said  any shiny that is not immediately identifiable as a shiny should be changed  rapidish should be bright blue  not greysilver the green  pinkpurple  and gold shinies could use a revisit they do nt all have to be changed  but i would like shinies to be interesting variations  not just  uh  it s gold so it s special   
3079,pokemon,garchomp i hate the fact that it  and many other shiny pokemon  is pretty much indistinguishable from their regular forms imagine how awesome a red or black garchomp would have looked 
3080,pokemon,my parents never let me buy any console  but there were a few months at my school where everybody was playing pokemon on emulators on our computers in class  and i absolutely loved it i did nt finish catching them all  in both yellow or firered   as by then the students had moved onto the next game  but i always though that i would buy it later on  when the 20th anniversary announcments popped up on the front page of reddit  i bought a 3ds  y and as as of now i ve got 436 pokemon in y  and havent even put the os cartridge into my 3ds as that would mean have to stop and take the y cartridge out 
3081,pokemon,torterra s shiny from dppt looked great with the more tile blue color shared with the shiny colors of its preevolutions unfortunately  someone had the bright idea in hgss to change torterra s shiny to just being that awful light green and leave his preevs  shiny colors in tact this is the shiny that makes me the angriest because they got it right the first time and then decided to ruin it 
3082,pokemon,honestly  blastoise and dragonite the colours clash with each other 
3083,pokemon,the rules are simple  below are 11 match ups of 22 random pokemon all you guys have to do is choose between the two pokemon which is your favorite i will be including all 721 pokemon  but wo nt be including mega evolutions of course a mega evolution could be a factor to why you like a pokemon  warning if a pokemon loses the match it will be eliminated and will not be returning  if you like both pokemon then i would suggest you click the pass option which if it has the most votes  the two pokemon will be paired off with different pokemon this will also happen if there is a tie  i am planning to do this everyday until we reach 1 pokemon  i appreciate any participation the fights will take 1 day to finish  the next post will have the results and the next fights  the great pokemon revival is your chance to revive a fallen pokemon from a previous fights at the rate we are going we ll end up with around 22 pokemon i would like to have an even 24 so it s easier to do the elimination the two winners of the revival will be announced when we start the finals to avoid cheating i had to choose the vote once option sadly this means you have to have a google account to submit a vote you can vote once per post there will only be two pokemon coming back so make it count  remember this is a popularity contest  not a  who would win in a fight    the fights     googlformsos2fxczxfn   the progress     <URL> grey  eliminated white  has nt fought this roundcurrently fighting green  goes to the next round   the great pokemon revival     googlformsthxayf1j9l want to check out previous fights    round 1     <URL>   round 2     <URL>   round 3     <URL>   round 4     <URL> do nt forget to upvote this so we can get as many voters as we can  or not  i m not forcing you at the end of the day please remember this is just for fun thank you for taking the time to read thisparticipate  ok i love you bye bye
3084,pokemon,mega garchomp  why why did they murder your manliness
3085,pokemon,weavile imagine the gray skin is swapped for dark blue  its red parts <URL> snow white  the claws <URL> blood red  and its little gold thing in the center of its head <URL> light blue  that was a missed opportunity for an awesome shiny
3086,pokemon,latios and the mega lati  s latias has a great shiny  golden and shit latios  is pretty crappy and their megas are like  crappy dark green  togekiss  persian  gengar  all the ones you ca nt tell 
3087,pokemon,personally i would want any pokemon who s shiny color pallete is virtually indistinguishable from its normal color pallete to be different almost no one dislikes shiny mega gengar  but shiny gengar is merely a brightness level notch different from its regular version how awesome would a white gengar or for that matter haunter be

3090,pokemon,ursaring i always thought their shiny should ve been a dark grey or black  like a black bear why lime green 
3091,pokemon,i feel like there needs to be a few general rules for shinies from now on  normal color gt  shiny color pink gt  blue red gt  gold blue gt  red  navy blue  or purple green gt   eyepleasing color other than green  it kinda varies from pok  mon to pok  mon  and nothing should ever be lime green darker green is fine  but lime green should never be used for shinies
3092,pokemon,i ve been hoping to see someone make a pokeball ball gown for years now that looks fantastic  excellent design work   
3093,pokemon,poor slugma is grey   also  i always thought miltank  gen ii sprite  as well as swinub  snubbulland claydol look like the printer ran out of ink or something  or undersaturated edit  spelling
3094,pokemon,i would ve liked garchomp to keep gible s bright blue and yellow belly  or the bright blue and redorange from gabite at least garchomp looks somewhat nicer in gen 6
3095,pokemon,gt  then i shall i turn it into a steelix great grammar check 
3096,pokemon,so beautiful  i ca nt imagine how luxurious the luxury ballgown would be  
3097,pokemon,man  the community works fast  already  people are dressing up like magiana 
3098,pokemon,2 options  do they prefer storygraphics or simplicityadventure  if the first  blackwhite if the second  redblueyellowfireredleafgreen 
3099,pokemon,bw seems like a good starting point imo so those  followed by b2w2 and so on xy were good as a jumping on point  but gen v had a soft reboot kinda feel to it it s like modern gen 1 it even resets the routes  they might be wondering what happened to the other routes if you pick xy  
3100,pokemon,that s amazing op
3101,pokemon,druddigon anything d be better than the puke green color it has now 
3102,pokemon,in a perfect world  this would be the wedding gown of my future wife 
3103,pokemon,poor swampert needs a different color mudkip is adorable and marshtomp can pull it off  but shiny swampert just does nt exude the sheer manliness of the pokemon well at all 
3104,pokemon,if you plan on doing more you should get a better camera  find someone with a better camera  there s a lot of visible noise 
3105,pokemon,the punning  intensifies 
3106,pokemon,pikachu please  please  please 
3107,pokemon,needs more morty        
3108,pokemon,if you  like me  have endured watching all of your favorite pokemon perish with each passing round and can no longer find a pokemon worth standing behind  i plead my case to you unite with me in reviving a pokemon who can represent the under appreciated who time after time must watch the likes of lucario and greninja win out we all know his name  but he can only be rescued if we all place our support towards him who is he you may ask  he is shinx and i encourage you to place your revival cast for him so that he reemerge and conquer this challenge    tl  dr  bring back shinx  
3109,pokemon,will you eventually make a giant bracket graph so we can see all matchups in one place 
3110,pokemon,i was legitimately worried that jolteon might not make it through this is such a relief 
3111,pokemon,you look like a disney princess with that  i do nt know if all ball gowns work like that
3112,pokemon,come on gengar 
3113,pokemon,regice it was decent the first few games  but you can hardly tell a difference in oras  i d like it to be partially seethrough as a shiny  with cloudy parts throughout it  like actual ice 
3114,pokemon,there was an electrical fire somewhere i think you d get along 
3115,pokemon,definitely plusle almost wonder traded that one away  until i saw a red star i mean come on  can you tell if number  1     <URL>  or number  2     <URL>  is shiny 
3116,pokemon,i really like the stain glass stylization it d be interesting to see this as actual glass 
3117,pokemon,i ve always thought it d be cool if espeon was white with a black gem 
3118,pokemon,i never gave it up but i get major itchs to play when i watch it with my two year old 
3119,pokemon,personally  i love starting a new game all the excitement and anticipation  being greeted by a pokemon professor  meeting new friends i love the  <URL> to the world of pokemon      <URL>  v  7zbs3xcpuy  music from x and y  it perfectly captures all those feelings for me and never fails to brighten my day 
3120,pokemon,encountering a shiny while playing through the games really gets me pumped 
3121,pokemon,i ll make a short list  lighting rod  pichu  pikachu galewings fletchling anticipation  eevee contray  snivy just to name a few 
3122,pokemon,i personally would have preferred a gold hydreigon as a further shoutout to ghidorah  a light blue onix to acknowledge the crystal onix from the anime a bluish purple for the piplup line blue magmar would look cooler because blue flames are typically hotter
3123,pokemon,yaaaaassss gurl   
3124,pokemon,hgss because you get the best version of johto and the only good version of kanto  which means that you ve already got 2 gens covered also  hgss are just masterpieces  so there s that too 
3125,pokemon,what did you do to get the dress to be that big 
3126,pokemon,who s gon na tell ushinx_fucker 
3127,pokemon,i actually want it to sound like gen 5 gen 5 had the best sound design and music everything just sounded more epic in gen 5 if i had to pick one  i d pick hgss though why  because hgss 
3128,pokemon,fighting a villainous team s boss for the final time i m always sure to crank the music up and limit items so the fight is super intense 
3129,pokemon,oras had a really boring ost imo everything just felt like a boring remaster  it just is nt creative yesi m one of those people who likes hgss route 29
3130,pokemon,my friend got me oras for my birthday after not really touching pokemon for nearly a couple of years after i finish the national dex i m gunna go back and play all the previous games i own  
3131,pokemon,what s the one pokemon  that when it shows up against you in battle  even aicontrolled  it annoys you the absolute most and why  for me  it s bronzong bronzong has a ridiculous amount of resistances paired with two abilities that can negate one of its weaknesses as well as having a decent amount of bulk  it can power down fire types with rain dance  up its own defense with iron defense  absolutely destroy with gyro ball  <URL> a mobile tank with trick room  and  when ai controlled typically  makes my whole team fall asleep with its hypnosis  battlemaisonhax this guy s impossible to ohko for me  anyone else have a specific pokemon that really annoys them 
3132,pokemon,picture this  you re running through the grass or a cave and you run into a wobbuffet you do nt feel like battling it  so you try to run  but nope damn thing has shadow tag as if to rub salt in the wound  the first move it uses is destiny bond  forcing you to either waste balls on a pokemon you already have in your pokedex or let your pokemon faint 
3133,pokemon,rotom fucking wash    how the hell does a washing machine levitate and burn you  bane of my existence i have mold breaker handy just to deal with the son of a balthazeer 
3134,pokemon,talonflame is the worst thing to exist since stealth rock in my opinion at least 
3135,pokemon,bronzongs  huh   d i admit it bronzong is really annoying in battle maison its always the same set  hypnosis  trick room  rain dance  gyro ball but to be honest in competitive play its less annoying  because nobody runs hypnosis and you barely ever see trick room although  if you want some advice on how to handle bronzong    strong ghost and dark type pokemon are really good gengar  chandelure  houndoom or tyranitar for example none of them take much from a gyro ball and can deal some really good damage to bronzong as ghost and dark are his only weaknesses  that he can not negate  but anyways  talonflame talonflame talonflame talonflame talonflame talonflame talonflame talonflame talonflame talonflame i just hate that bird 
3136,pokemon,this is more of a recent one but sewaddle and swadloon ive already had 2 pokemon in my current white 2 nuzlocke  purrloin  one level away from evolving  and solosis  who i thought could kill it with hp rock  die from crit bug bites  and of course special mention to random gym trainer s sewaddle for bringing my watchog to 4hp with crit razor leaf 
3137,pokemon,i really hated boldore in 5th gen it s not bad enough that the buggers are just as bad as zubats  but they also have to have sturdy 
3138,pokemon,gliscor good luck getting rid it when it spams protect and substitute while getting healed by its toxic orb 
3139,pokemon,shedinja at one point in sapphire  i had no moves that were effective against one so i lost i suspect that this is very annoying in competitive battles as well 
3140,pokemon,clefable i always dread seeing it in fear what kind of bullshit strategy that trainer is using to ruin my fun this time 
3141,pokemon,i stopped after pokemon diamond and pokemon go brought me back
3142,pokemon,i recently posted a very similar drawing of misty here  and someone requested a commission they never ended up purchasing the piece  so here it is 
3143,pokemon,definitely rapidash i mean ponyta is one of the best shinies and rapidash looks so bad compared to it would never evolve my ponyta
3144,pokemon,i stopped playing after black and white  then i found a girlfriend who loves pokemon  we ve been together ever since i m also still with her 
3145,pokemon,you can check the serebii archives for news and the concept of  poketubers  were hardly established
3146,pokemon,let s go empoleon 
3147,pokemon,i started to miss the series really badly  even 
3148,pokemon,i missed it 
3149,pokemon,i d go with hgss  while i enjoy oras s soundtrack  i would have preferred to had a key item equivalent to gb sounds to listen to the originals if i felt like it  even though in ss  i almost never used the gb sounds 
3150,pokemon,you look like a ritzy challenger trainer  like maybe you d be on a cruise ship or something  
3151,pokemon,the  obey  thing seems really out of place  as much as i love flareon but i love this  super nice job on the flames 
3152,pokemon,i do nt get involved in the meta  so mine is ingame only  kingdra  prefairy type it only had one weakness  other dragons and more often than not  when it appears in fights  it was given moves that make it impossible to hit i wanted juan to be in oras solely for the satisfaction of wiping his kingdra s smug  double teaming ass with a single  well placed moonblast  but i was nt given the chance 
3153,pokemon,shuckle really frustrating to beat and really frustrating to use 
3154,pokemon,in doubles  anything with dark void   cough    smeargle   cough   heck  it s even what this year s vgc meta is partly centralized upon 
3155,pokemon,i choose you 
3156,pokemon,i just hate all dark types because i have a delphox and a gardevoir on my team  and gardevoir is my strongest member
3157,pokemon,the fact that your flair and flair text is based on steel  that made me laugh to this more yknow yknow 
3158,pokemon,crobat and magikarp s shiny is beautiful for the record 
3159,pokemon,magicarp because he s fuckin useless and a waste of time and every generation has that fuckin trainer who has 6 of them  fuck that guy 
3160,pokemon,garchomp any other colour will do just not literally the same colour why 
3161,pokemon,xy  i loved how the starters looked that and yvetal looked amazing i could nt take blackwhite seriously  and pokemon like trubbish made the game look  well  like rubbish 
3162,pokemon,squirtle squad 
3163,pokemon,our we still doing phrasing 
3164,pokemon,i think pikachu would look really cool with blackgrey as shiny
3165,pokemon,in my opinion biggest upsets  charizard  pikachu  rayquaza  lugia biggest surprises  rapidash  vaporeon  glaceon  dusknior  froslass  archeops favorites to win it all  dragonite  mewtwo  swampert  lucario what do yall think 
3166,pokemon,roggenrola it always has sturdy 
3167,pokemon,there does nt seem to be a consistent outline formula that you use black outlines are used where the shadows are the darkest i used to sprite  i made bw kyurem sprites before those sprites were first previewed 
3168,pokemon,heart gold or soul silver
3169,pokemon,norman s slaking in oras it seems like no matter what fightingtype you have or how fast your fightingtype is this mufucka always seems to turn the tables on you or whitney s miltank it seems like once it uses rollout all of your pokemon get ko d imagine doing the nuzlocke challenge facing these two fuck that
3170,pokemon,butterfree it should ve been made pink like the one ash s butterfree flies away with 
3171,pokemon,almost every green shiny 
3172,pokemon, gifv link     <URL>    faq     <URL> 
3173,pokemon,i see cartman s excited  no joke  this was good 
3174,pokemon,kabutops noooooooooo
3175,pokemon,why does misty have only two toes  looks amazing 
3176,pokemon,you should do the rest  and then keep messing around  i really like these 
3177,pokemon,somewhat getting some ginyu force vibes here looks good 
3178,pokemon,i wish sugimori had nt stopped doing his watercolour style after gen 2 his current style is just so much more generic 
3179,pokemon,these are great 
3180,pokemon,i love ken s style for pok  mon  good job 
3181,pokemon,this is great  i love the gen 1 art so much 
3182,pokemon,the moment you realize that the dog s name is acually butch 
3183,pokemon,you have great talent dude  
3184,pokemon,join avenue  street pass  profit that place was so good for a bit of extra farming 6th gen would work wonders for it 
3185,pokemon,different pok  mon depending on the time of day i always thought that was cool 
3186,pokemon,walking with pokemon 
3187,pokemon,i currenty use  this     jb244<SMILE>infovarresizespokemon_special_miscellaneousgot ta  20catch  20em  20all  20wallpaperjpg  m  1379349204  on my laptop and  this     pre15deviantartnet17b<SMILE>thpref20130<SMILE>695_492_shaymin_wallpaper_by_maii1234d5zhgzsjpg  on my tablet  i believe the first one was from some old official promotion pokemon did  the second was just something i found on google when i set up my tablet 
3188,pokemon,after 3 years without playing pokemon  i played pokemon liquid crystal on my psp by the time black and white 2 were released that was all i needed  amazing hack by the way 
3189,pokemon,hgss i moved away from pokemon in middle school  but my college roommate never did after a semester of living with the guy  i caved and bought a 3ds and a copy of soul silver 
3190,pokemon,i think it s something pixiv started 
3191,pokemon,are there any other holidays 
3192,pokemon,i do nt know why i love tracy the koala this much  
3193,pokemon,i thought it was going to be pokemon in the style of animal crossing a bit disappointed 
3194,pokemon,want
3195,pokemon,i remember seeing  these     <URL>  a while back thought i would share 
3196,pokemon,who s the eagle in the vest next to gary supposed to be 
3197,pokemon,i do nt mean to be rude  but would nt this be even better if they were pokemon  
3198,pokemon,i thought it was happy tree friends 
3199,pokemon,the pokewalker it was really awesome having the ability to level my favorite pokemon and potentially catch some rare ones while i was out and about without having to lug around my ds the design of the pokewalker itself was really cool as well 
3200,pokemon,this made me happier than i d anticipated
3201,pokemon,pokemon following you like in hgss
3202,pokemon,this is relevant fanart  especially since there is a new samurai jack series coming this year 
3203,pokemon,love that take on giratina 
3204,pokemon,apricots would be ideal but i ll throw one out there that probably wo nt be said  the pokeathelon it was essentially mini games but it depended on how good your pokemon naturally was without training  unless you used the bracelets but it hindered and each pokemon had different stats  i loved it in the sense that it took away from the games and provided a different genre 
3205,pokemon,walking pok  mon that travel beside you like pikachu in yellow or your pok  mon in hgss 
3206,pokemon,let s be clear here  it s probably not because it was actually the most popular ad more likely  the people who are the most likely to vote on an internet poll  or rally to vote on said poll   are pokemon fans 
3207,pokemon,we ve just had this discussion  but  poison damage in the overworld  and fainting from it is my  1 wish 
3208,pokemon,good for them 
3209,pokemon,this was uploaded today  i feel like i ve missed some kind of z announcement  it says the show starts on the 20th 
3210,pokemon,that s not <SMILE>bit why do nt you kids know this 
3211,pokemon,oh man  the team rocket moving in and out of the bush made this for me 
3212,pokemon, <SMILE> bit pokemon     lparchiveorgpokemonblueupdate  20011capture_02042010_120644png 
3213,pokemon,lists everyone but psyduck  psy 
3214,pokemon,i m currently drooling over these    <URL> 
3215,pokemon,that s so cute  but his head is a little bit small 
3216,pokemon,let s share them for the benefit of others also i kinda want a new wallpaper as well 
3217,pokemon, this     <URL>  is nt technically designed to be a wallpaper  but it s my absolute favorite piece of official video game art as a johto fangirl  i just  love  how it captures the feeling of the region as a whole  
3218,pokemon,i got my top favorite right here    <URL>  20  20155063  20samplejpg i love reshiram  d besides that  i sometimes go with this    <URL> this one too    <URL> and this one was custom made for me by someone i knew in the forums    <URL>

3234,pokemon,the substitute clipon made me think of something  klefki customization 
3235,pokemon,these really are incredible i hope you continue to share more 
3236,pokemon,garchomp messed up sooo bad pikachu in the same manner as well 
3237,pokemon,literally every green shiny in existence 
3238,pokemon,all of the ones that are identical to normal gengar  bidoof  pikachu  etc 
3239,pokemon,i wish vaporeon s shiny was a different color i m not a fan of the pink i d be fine with a more grayish purple  think haunter   or a grey or teal 
3240,pokemon,butterfree would be cool if the shiny form is pink just like the pink butterfree from the anime
3241,pokemon,the ballgown is amazing but i ca nt lie the red hair helps emphasize the tophalf of the time  the line was either cut off or too long 
3242,pokemon,starmie
3243,pokemon,that pun alone is front page worthy
3244,pokemon,  <URL>
3245,pokemon,what is your favorite cartridge art  for me i think i either like pokemon black 2 or soul silver 
3246,pokemon,i always liked pokemon emerald s cartridge sticker with the little shimmer it had on it 
3247,pokemon,sapphire s because of the blue  or leafgreen s for the cool green swirl design 
3248,pokemon,i always liked the art for gen 3  mainly because the cartridges themselves are coloured to match the game  and the stickers are shiny i also liked crystal s cartridge because it had sparkles in it
3249,pokemon,yeah  mine is black 2 too 
3250,pokemon,sapphire s holographic 
3251,pokemon,eh  personally i find litwick pretty cute  mr mime tho 
3252,pokemon,danny devito is my new nickname
3253,pokemon,honestly this trailer was less harsh than i thought since the dp trailer was already harsh enough  before watching  i thought all this video was going to be was all  introducing the generation that ruined the pokemon name and everyone s childhood  because there s gears  ice cream  candles  and garbage and we ca nt use actual good designs  
3254,pokemon, some more f       birds  that was when i knew it was perfect bw had so many flying types  also how dare they come at chandelure like that   i still laughed though 
3255,pokemon,every single name was really clever 
3256,pokemon, and more fiddly lower screen b    s     this was my exact reaction when i first turned pokemon white on and started playing 
3257,pokemon,i want to wonder trade a bunch of  valuable  ha pokemon which hidden abilities do you all think are the most valuable  but also actually obtainable without cheating  obviously   just want to spread some cheer 
3258,pokemon,evolving pokemon through friendship really makes me happy  when i first played pokemon way back in crystal  i caught a zubat as one of my first pokemon i got it up to golbat and thought that was it for my little friend but later in my adventure  it evolved into crobat i was both excited and confused  not knowing what i did it was nt until later that i learned that it evolves based on happiness it had such a profound impact on me as kid that i pretty much had a crobat in every game from then on  nowadays i ve seemed to have lost most of the heart i had as a kid but my crobat reminds me to enjoy the game and not get too technical 
3259,pokemon,any one know if anything similar is going down in the uk 
3260,pokemon,i made myself a living pokedex  but i may play the game normally before transferring it to the next game 
3261,pokemon,someone play the kingdom hearts theme softly
3262,pokemon,i noticed that you have a venusaur from your history  do you by any chance have a version of it without the text just like this charizard 
3263,pokemon,  
3264,pokemon,aaaaand i want this
3265,pokemon,ooh  pretty
3266,pokemon,awesome
3267,pokemon,this is awesome  how many of these do you plan on doing 
3268,pokemon,meganium  tt
3269,pokemon,in chronicles it s shown that the sisters became  actress models  and misty took over as gym leader 
3270,pokemon,i would nt give a 10 year old a piece of  25 jewelry let alone <SMILE> of them 
3271,pokemon,hey there reddit  i know that there have been loooots of threads discussing which feature would you like to see in the gts and so and so but i was just thinking  a showerthought  of a fusion between the gts and the normal trade  what if we would be able to send pokemon to a friend when they are not connected and once they connect they get a message like  your friend sent you this pokemon  sent him some poke to complete the trade or dismiss the trade something like that could people like me  who loves to send and get pokes from people in reddit but because i live in gmt  1 i m not able to be connected at the same time as the redditor i m willing to trade with  what do you think about it  which will be other features regarding trades that you ll like to see or you think may help  tl  dr  i like to see a new feature for online trading in which i could sent pokemons to a friend even when they are disconnected and once they connect they cand send me back and complete the trade 
3272,pokemon,with feraligatr out of the game  venusaur is my last hope i know it does nt stand a chance if it goes up against a fan favourite like lucario or something  i m just hoping it gets a little farther at least 
3273,pokemon,this is actually a brilliant idea and i d love to see it implemented
3274,pokemon,i would love to have a  gift a pokemon  option it would be a nice surprise for my son to receive a mon without a trade 
3275,pokemon,i quit playing when gen 3 came out because kid logic dictated that the absence of a lot of older pokemon and the inability to bring them forward from gen 2 meant they d gotten rid of them entirely  including a lot of my favorites  i came back in 2012 because pokemon was huge on my college campus  and i felt like i was missing out 
3276,pokemon,  when i brutally massacred that bitch rival blue s team and abruptly ended his reign as a worthless champion in frlg   when my pokemans have max happiness yayayay
3277,pokemon, absol vs weavile    oh no i know this is nt the most intense but this is truly worrisome gt  _lt 
3278,pokemon,since both shinx and vulpix are out  i guess i m rooting for glaceon now
3279,pokemon,pass  pass  pass  pass  pass 
3280,pokemon,she belongs in your ds  not your heart 
3281,pokemon,seems like certain people on youtube hate the way oras was done  but when they look at hgss it s  too overdone   what  
3282,pokemon,i loved the oras soundtrack  especially the new songs it added 
3283,pokemon,the problem i have with hgss s gb sounds is that you have to basically beat the entire game to get it  so instead of going through the whole game with original music you basically have to sit through with new music and then at the veeeeeeery end you get the gameboy sounds  would have been better if they had given you the item earlier in the game or just skip the item and make it an option in the sound settings 
3284,pokemon,if i showup past 2 pm and they still have stuff left would they give it out even if i dont have a kid with me 
3285,pokemon,bah  that would require effort 
3286,pokemon,honestly read this as  why is nt misty black   nvm continue as usual
3287,pokemon,she got replaced by may since people liked her more than misty misty has nt been in the anime for over 10 years she s pretty much a dead character by now just one of many girls ash has traveled with 
3288,pokemon,misty claimed that she was only going to travel with ash until he got her bike repaired once her bike was fixed up  she no longer had a reason to follow him around 
3289,pokemon, i never left o_o
3290,pokemon,after watching battle frontier again  i just realizedmisty was supposed temporarily take over cerulean gym until her sisters came back from the trip around the world  in battle frontier  the sisters return  but misty is still running the gym  should nt she be back with ash now 
3291,pokemon,i m still gon na go and see what i can get i did nt read the fine print that said anything about it being children only screw that nonsense  if i buy one of those new expansion packs or whatever  they better damn give me those two cards  also  i live in a podunk area  so hopefully they wo nt have much traffic and are just gon na go ahead and give me the free cards without any questions i do nt have any kids i can borrow  so if anything i ll try and makeup some story about  my child  being sick or that im surprising them or whatever 
3292,pokemon,giratina on the platinum box art  it looked too good to pass up stopped playing when i saw the design of the regis and thought i was too good for rs i ve since purchased emerald and followed the steps to actually catch all three golems  proving once and for all that i am better than them 
3293,pokemon,i thought about leaving pokemon after binging on pearl  messing around with some action replay codes along the way   and seeing blackwhite s new pokemon kinda drove the nail in the coffin  yes  i took a naive approach to them and called a few of them  outlandish  really ashamed of that now that i think about it   the bw anime arc also drove me to stop watching the new episodes  however  when i was browsing a gamestop one day about 3 years ago  i noticed there was a blackwhite 2 i went with my instinct and bought black 2  as i needed to fill the void left by leaving pokemon boy  was i blown away at how great black 2 is i even put in more hours on that game than my pearl save file ever since then i ve been following pokemon again through the end of gen 5 and currently into gen 6  and maybe even 7 if magearna is our first look into the next generation i really enjoy watching the xy arc more than playing the current gen games though  to be honest 
3294,pokemon,twitch plays pokemon got me back into the games  even getting me to play red for the first time from start to finish black and white 1 just were nt very interesting games to me initially  aside from the story  so i had nt played a new game until tpp then i realized i had missed out on quite a bit 
3295,pokemon,i had been out of the franchise for a long time  since 2003   about 2 months ago my roommate got a wiiu with ssb4 this led to me getting a few amiibos i really liked lucario s style and bought and trained a lucario amiibo  who is a force to be reckoned with and frankly  he scares me   the game was nt enough i wanted to know his  lucario  backstory and lore i watched his movie and then the episodes featuring him the new animation style of xy drew me in i watched all of the xy series in a weekend and now i am waiting for more episodes to be released  the itch is something real  as i had only ever played the original red now i want a 3ds  merch  plushies  games  ect  currently i am waiting for poken tournament to be released i will probably end up getting a wiiu just for it 
3296,pokemon,lack of money lol i ca nt picture my life without pokemon
3297,pokemon,shortly after getting heartgold and soulsilver i stopped playing  never actually beat it before i stopped   then about 1 year before black and white 2 released i got a 3ds and found about black and white  i bought it on a whim and quickly beat the game then did nt touch pokemon until black and white 2 that was right when all my friends got back into pokemon  they all stopped after diamond and pearl  and we started battling and trading almost everyday 
3298,pokemon,i never left 
3299,pokemon,i enjoyed the series from the very beginning shortly after oras came out  i beat it and then got really busy with life stuff i m not super busy with life stuff and am usually free during the evenings now  with that out of the way  chuggaaconroy  one of the very few youtubers i still watch  recently started playing through pokemon platinum  and hearing him talk about the game and the series as a whole rekindled my love for the franchise  so  now i m replaying oras  specifically alpha sapphire  and am working on building a competitive team and getting into the whole competitive scene for pokemon again 
3300,pokemon,pokemon black and white i had nt touched my ds in over a year i blew through a gift copy of diamond and was nt all that impressed  did the same with soul silver then stopped giving a shit i bought a new ds lite and picked up black it was awesome best story i had seen in a long time and for some reason it felt like red to me everything felt new and oh my god the graphics and even the music was top grade for pokemon
3301,pokemon,honestly i was sitting at home with nothing to do one day so i picked up my old gba with crystal in and just like that i was in again 
3302,pokemon,took a break after pearl and came back during x amp  y loved it and got hooked on vvc  which can potentially be unlimited content due to the ladder 
3303,pokemon,i grew bored of pokemon around gen 4 i did nt even know about those games until the day i bought my ds lite my dad offered to buy me a game so he got me diamond i just got it because it was pokemon then i just kind of put pokemon on the back burner when gen 5 was announced the fire was inginited and i fell in love with the series again 
3304,pokemon,i found a thread on this subreddit  i knew some newer generations were out but i had fallen outtaken a break  however you want to say it a brief conversation in a thread made me recharge my old ds and hunt for my copy of diamond i was using as my storage i saw all my old pokemon both leveled and not still there  waiting for me what really did it though was seeing my old blastoise  my original starter from pok  mon blue he changed a little since i started him over in leaf green  but he was still there i made the decision right then to get a 3ds and return   so here i sit at work  thinking about my old blastoise with my 3ds and my as marshtomp happily in my bag waiting for work to slow down so i can make the final adjustments to my team and make my way to the elite 4 for the first time in several years  edit  formatting and spelling
3305,pokemon,pokemon black i played since red and stopped at sapphire i was tempted to get fire red but by then pok  mon was nt popular in my school anymore and i did nt wan na look childish skipped out on the entirety of gen 4 i have a friend who s never stopped playing  and he <URL> black to me as it had an entirely new set of pokemon without any mon s from the previous gens appearing in the main story  needless to say i loved black  having to learn the physicalspecial split  wifi battling  wireless trading and exploring an entirely new region of completely new pokemon was great since then i ve played and beaten every main series game at least once since the release of black 2  i have a living dex and i ve took up shiny hunting gen 5 made me fall in love with the series all over again
3306,pokemon,one day i wondered to myself what actually happened in the anime and if ash ever got all <SMILE> badges  when i was a kid  they only got so far before switching back to repeats   so i went back and watched it  and got a massive nostalgia hit while watching  i decided to look up how many episodes there were  and was surprised to find out it was still going and that the games were the main media of the franchise  so i decided to catch up on the anime and try the games  which i immediately loved   as for why i thought of pokemon at all in the first place  it was actually because i stumbled across pokemon porn during one of many such searches in my horny teen years so really i owe it all to the people that draw pokemon porn  which has always amused me 
3307,pokemon,i started watchinh during gen2 with the anime and i got crystal for christmas and i recently got back into it because i started rewatching the anime 
3308,pokemon,my friend kind of forced me to get cards to play the tcg with him  and also pokemon rby coming on eshop 
3309,pokemon,hgss in 2010 i was joking watching tv with my brother about how shit all of pokemon is  even the ones i fucked  gen 1   without having fucked any gaem after gen 1  and a few seconds later we saw a commercial for hgss  iirc it was launch day it looked awesome  went to the store  bought the gaem  and the rest is history 
3310,pokemon,since i got my start when the game first released  i originally stopped playing when ruby and sapphire were announced at that point  i was approaching high school and various factors kicked in  i focused more on other games  video games  tcgs   pokemon had a stigma attached to it  i did nt have a gba  and was nt really looking to get one at the time   and  obviously  schoolrelated activities became more commonplace but  one of the big factors was that  after having played a sequel to the original games in gsc  i was disappointed to go somewhere new with no connections to the previous games and have very few returning pokemon  i wanted to pick the series back up when frlg came out  but i did nt have the funds to buy it or a gba i remember being intrigued by diamond and pearl  but  again  not excited enough to jump back into the fold once hgss were announced  and i was in college   i pounced back in as gsc had been my favorites for a long time by that point i did skip gen v on release because  as like with ruby and sapphire  the  reboot  aspect kinda rubbed me the wrong way  but the story in gen v is arguably the best in the main series  i again picked the series back up with xy riding the hype of 3d and the fact that a lot of people were diving back in to the series  but i found it lackluster  and it was nt for the fact that i had wanted to play through hoenn and did nt want to go back to the prephysicalspecial split era to do it  i might not have picked up oras the next game s announcement  features  etc are going to make or break whether i continue with the series again or not  i m just so burned out of doing the same things over and over and over again with the series and being  bored  while doing it if there was a fromthestartofthegame difficulty selection  as there  should  be   having to slog through the same overall plot outline each time might be more bearable to me 
3311,pokemon,i took a break from pok  mon during my time as an undergraduate to concentrate on my degree i downloaded the anime  but did nt even make time to watch it i took a gap year to apply for phd courses during that year  i consumed what existed of the games and anime of gen v  knowing that the resettheteameverygeneration formula meant i could understand unova anime without sinnoh but i had enough time to go back to sinnoh too  and i vowed to stay with the franchise thereafter 
3312,pokemon,i played first gen because my older sister played it she lost interest in pokemon afterwards and then so did i i started playing again when a friend in elementary school introduced me to the latest pokemon game  pokemon diamond my elementarymiddle school friends have stopped playing pokemon  but i have nt stopped playing since 
3313,pokemon,i m not back  i have nt played a game since b2w2 because i feel that the newer games have nt progressed enough to be worth buying a 3ds  if they improve the graphics i might give it a go on their next console 
3314,pokemon,honestly  out of nowhere bought a tcg pack i do nt play competitively  never have and never plan on it but i opened the back  got hyped up  bought a 2ds and or only thing i ve missed is black and white 12 and x and y all so worth it 
3315,pokemon,i played generation 3 games most of all the remake brought me back the games have so much strategy and depth that it changed me from a casual player to a heavy breeder also trading is so much fun 
3316,pokemon,the older generations have tremendous replay value to me and i ve never really left the games themselves despite playing only from time to time whenever i m in the mood 
3317,pokemon,i stopped after gen 2  i saw that there were remakes in early 2013 played both fire red and heart gold and while searching the internet for help i was finding youtube videos on x and y coming out and i really liked what i saw  after having a lot of fun with the remakes i got x and i went all in 
3318,pokemon,when i was in 4th grade as a new student  there was this popular kid who would flaunt his best pokemon cards all the time  so around christmas time i asked literally every family member only to get me pokemon cards and i already was a spoiled brat  i got a ton of them because they were cheap after i got to gloat over all my rare and amazing cards  i started play diamond when it came out and sunk like 200 hours into it 
3319,pokemon,i thought i was too old for it  then  i got diabetes  and i was paralysed at hospital my older brother bought pokemon y for me  as he could nt be my side all night long  the noises from the other person did nt allow me more than 1 hour of sleep per night   as pok  mon saved me from boredom  i ve gotten into it again 
3320,pokemon,what makes you think i left    p
3321,pokemon,waiting for it to come out on smartphones before delving back in since the gba days 
3322,pokemon,my little sister was watching indigo league on netflix  decided to watch a few episodes and got back into it
3323,pokemon,twitch plays pok  mon  i followed it quite a bit during downtime at work  and it gave me nostalgia in a major way i stopped playing after crystal so i decided to try a couple of the  newer  games  leaf green and emerald  on an emulator playing again on anything other than a handheld felt wrong  so i used my nephew s birthday as an excuse to pick up two 3ds red and y for him  blue and x for me 
3324,pokemon,ninetales
3325,pokemon,firered and leafgreen  i was too busy being a genwunner but was convinced to play the remakes and loved the new game mechanics  graphics and new pokemon post game
3326,pokemon,vietnamese crystal
3327,pokemon,keep your eye out for phoenix rising because it s gon na be very big very soon 
3328,pokemon,omega ruby and alpha sapphire i left after x and y came out  and i got really bored of it  and i barely played when oras came out they sat untouched until earlier 2016  when  after going back and playing through black 2 for some pokemon memories  thought  why do nt i give it a go  i had some of the most fun i ve ever had in a single player game  and now i m back into pokemon  omega ruby and alpha sapphire reminded me of how great it was  edit  words
3329,pokemon,pokemon solar light and lunar dark has all new pokemon and i think it is phenomenal definitely worth checking out
3330,pokemon,i played the shit outta glazed when it was in beta 56 it s great except when you get to johto it really loses its charm i lost interest very quickly after that <SMILE>10 
3331,pokemon,no  i wanted to see politoed 
3332,pokemon,this is so legit
3333,pokemon,this is amazing  definitely my new phone background  are there more  any larger prints to sell 
3334,pokemon,new phone background  this looks amazing 
3335,pokemon, black amp  white     <URL>  i found this  looking for xy
3336,pokemon,nice idea it s always fun to go down memory lane 
3337,pokemon,very nice  and bianca 2 years later is pretty sexy b 
3338,pokemon,i personally really enjoyed zetaomicron and fusion generation  but those are nt really romhacks also  fusion generation was taken down  but i can get you a copy also  snakewood is pretty good hard  but fun 
3339,pokemon,emerald randomizer shits so fun
3340,pokemon,shiny mew
3341,pokemon,love the position that red is drawn in gives some mystery to this wandering trainer 
3342,pokemon,mega charizard x represent  nice work  friend  
3343,pokemon,that looks amazing  well done 
3344,pokemon,really good  charizard looks like he s about to fuck shit up great job 
3345,pokemon, shiny persian     cdnbulbagardennetupload003spr_6x_053_spng  vs  regular persian     cdnbulbagardennetupload992spr_6x_053png  virtually indistinguishable god dammit 
3346,pokemon,absolutely stunning  you did a really great job 
3347,pokemon,shiny zorua looks great with its blue and black theme shiny zoarack just looks bad with purple instead of red  if it had followed zorua with blue it would look great 
3348,pokemon,metagross looks pretty bad imo i d rather it was purple or something it s too bright
3349,pokemon,floatzel  anything but that fucking yellow gold thing i like it on buizel but on floatzel it looks terrible
3350,pokemon,i d like a black empoleon perhaps with a silver tridentbeak 
3351,pokemon,all the green ones
3352,pokemon,ur hot
3353,pokemon,also  i do nt like mega charizard x s shiny coloration granted it d be hard to top its normal colors  but i find the shiny to be a little too festive with the red and dark green  and speaking of indiscernible shinies  i got a shiny growlithe on wonder trade  and i was nt even aware it was a shiny until i compared it with another growlithe in my pc 
3354,pokemon,i actually do nt like the pallets of most of the shinies  
3355,pokemon,i d like for there be a system where all the shinies get completely redone for the most part and they <URL> really cool and worth the hunt  but also something implemented like in pokemon stadium where different nicknames changed the color tints of the mons not necessarily nickname based  but making catching different pokemon for the different shades another collection aspect 
3356,pokemon,dragonite green is my favorite color  but not here he looks like a moldy green bean with wings he d look better with one of those indistinguishable shinies honestly i d say they should turn him black with a red belly 
3357,pokemon,i would like to have every single pok  mon whose shiny colouration is just a slight hue change to be revised i almost defeated a shiny glameow because i was nt paying attention and its shiny form is nearly identical to its ordinary colouration inbattle thank god for the sparkleeffect  also  shiny neutral xerneas is ugly af __
3358,pokemon,i once put a female hippowdon on gts and passed it off as a shiny got a giratina from it  3
3359,pokemon,magikarp  blue
3360,pokemon,honestly  while i m perfectly fine with shiny espeon  it is quite controversial  and i d definitely prefer a different color for it stadium 2 actually did a fantastic job with shiny espeon  making it more of a minty green rather than a neon green xy did make it more tolerable with a more grassgreen color  but yeah  i d love for it to just avoid green altogether and go with cyanlightblue 
3361,pokemon,leafeon make it s shiny be autumnlike colors
3362,pokemon,dewgong  you ca nt even tell it s any different 
3363,pokemon,dragonite it s so hideous in green 
3364,pokemon,gengar his mega form looks nice but his normal form  its like theres no difference  nvm  someone already said it 
3365,pokemon,fucking dragonite it goes from pink dragonair to god damn incredible hulk puke green seriously 
3366,pokemon,all the green ones never appealed to me 
3367,pokemon,kecleon
3368,pokemon,lucario and weavile just look awful really gt  gt 
3369,pokemon,lillipup i catched a shiny lillipup in a very random way and i only catched him because i was like   did some stars appeared around the dog  and then pum  it s a shinyonly a little bit brightier thant the original and with green eyes 
3370,pokemon,shiny espeon looks horrible

3372,pokemon, happinyblissey  green like chansey s shiny   misdreavusmismagius  either black  white  or have their regular color palettes swapped around and be their shiny form   dusknoir  it should be fuckin  red like the rest of its evo line   leafeon  it should be browntan like  this     <URL>  fanart pic everybody likes   vaporeon  either mint green or a very light coral orange   espeon  gold  white  darker purple  or silver     jolteon  light blue or either black fur but keep the  collar  white  or vice versa and make its fur a darker yellow  flareon  a more intense coloration of its regular form   glaceon  purple like vaporeon s current shiny form   vulpix  light cream or white  clefable amp  wigglytuff line  hot pink   togekiss line  replace the white with black or dark gray   groudon  rusty brown  kyogre  ice blue  lucario line  make the already blue fur dark navy and the black parts white or gray  i could probably think of a bunch more but this list is already too long as it is lol 
3373,pokemon,green machoke really kind of stinks 
3374,pokemon,blastoise is horrible just saying
3375,pokemon,fantastic  it s simple and gorgeous 
3376,pokemon,skitty i get it s supposed to be a cute pink kitten  but would nt it be awesome if its shiny form had light blue instead of darker pink  and delcatty could have a cyan instead of red or whatever
3377,pokemon,i wish shiny politoed was purple 
3378,pokemon,scizor way too cool of a pokemon to just get a run of the mill green color change 
3379,pokemon,shiny porygon have you look at it  cause you should nt 
3380,pokemon,raticate x1000 we need a blackcoated rat up in here

3453,pokemon,all aboard the ss nessie  all aboard the ss nessie 
3454,pokemon,voted for all the eons  no regrets 
3455,pokemon,alright  easy win for hydreigon the dragon has three heads also  voting against gengar out of spite 
3456,pokemon,how has glaceon made it so far  and does anyone else find it weird that the only non fully evolved mom is squirtle 
3457,pokemon,still confused about what ll happen to the pokemon left without a matchup 23 pokemon left for part 2 of round 5 
3458,pokemon,til i really like dragon pokemon voted for flygon  hydreigon  and salamence  really hoping breloom can make it out of this round i m amazed that it has made it this far 
3459,pokemon,looks amazing 
3460,pokemon,hoping that scizor wins 
3461,pokemon,damnscizor vs mewtwo is a tough one i m pretty sure mewtwo will win  but scizor is definitely a really popular pokemon too 
3462,pokemon,shits getting real now
3463,pokemon,really want breloom to pull through
3464,pokemon,milotic is still in this  that s literally all i cared about 
3465,pokemon,no  zoroark  dragonair  giratina  typhlosion  torterra  porygonz  at least milotic and dragonite are still in this else i wouldve just left
3466,pokemon,oh boy  hope my man empoleon  my first starter holds on go  my baby  go 
3467,pokemon,staraptor  torterra  shinx how could you 
3468,pokemon, mfw i read the winners     <URL>  noredirect  seriously  i m pleasantly surprised by a lot of them froslass and toxicroak are still in the game and that s all that matters 
3469,pokemon,the entire typhlosion line got knocked out o_o but let s go bois  swampert better at least make it out of round 5  d
3470,pokemon,i can not forgive you all for what you did to my favorite 
3471,pokemon, gt  shinx eliminated     <URL> 
3472,pokemon,wow charizard and pikachu are gone and rapidash is still in admittedly lucario and greninja are tough competition but still 
3473,pokemon,so there are 45 pok  mon remainingan odd number what ll we do about that 
3474,pokemon,gen v s doing pretty well this round  to be honest probably just because they got sent against kind of minoreh pokemon  but i m still impressed 
3475,pokemon,still got tyranitarbreloomflygon  salamence  and dusknoir go my picks 
3476,pokemon,poliwhirl must  live on to complete the prophecy 
3477,pokemon,rip teh urn all you ampharos losers need to see me in the street 
3478,pokemon,i m so disappointed that torterra is out
3479,pokemon,how am i ever gon na decide the final greninja vs toxicroak round 
3480,pokemon,goodbye staraptor  crobat and umbreon are the only two left in my major favorites 
3481,pokemon,1645 are capable of mega evolution  35  of pokemon capable of megaevolving survived  14 are gen i  9  of gen i survived  <SMILE> are gen ii  <SMILE>  of gen ii survived  <SMILE> are gen iii  6  of gen iii survived  <SMILE> are gen iv  7  of gen iv survived  4 are gen v  3  of gen v survived  3 are gen vi  4  of gen vi survived 
3482,pokemon,serious question  why did anyone vote for espeon over nidoking  the king is the most badass gen i pokemon  and espeon is nt even one of the more popular eeveelutions 
3483,pokemon,ahhhhh    bae has made it through another round   d keep it up 
3484,pokemon,mass shinx voting lets gooooooo
3485,pokemon, weavile vs absol  hot topic showdown of the century 
3486,pokemon,not a good round for me almost my entire top ten pokemon were eliminated today alone  the cyndaquil line was taken out in  one fell sweep     <URL>  
3487,pokemon,how the fuck is squirtle still here 
3488,pokemon,was nt sure umbreon would make it past typhlosion  and it was definitely close 
3489,pokemon,alright  i ll voting for azumarill s return now
3490,pokemon,yay dusknoir
3491,pokemon,and not a single eeveelution was eliminated that round damn 
3492,pokemon,very nice round  and quick too  the end of the elimination is nearing   also  absol beat dragonair  yay  and the shinx fan base explosion will begin is 32 
3493,pokemon,i assume we ll know the results of the revival at the beginning of the next round 
3494,pokemon,damn it  houndoom is out of the competition  how could you guys fail me 
3495,pokemon,all my favorites are out at this point i m rooting for dusknoir 
3496,pokemon,oh no  weavile   i have a feeling i ll be rooting for espeon from tomorrow on 
3497,pokemon,depends on their age while earlier games are graphically simple  later games are better with hand holding to show them the ropes graphically  i would nt go past gen 5 because it s hard to go back from 3d 
3498,pokemon,i d <URL> starting with fireredleafgreen then moving forward from there so emerald after that  then platinum  then heartgoldsoulsilver  then blackwhite  then black2white2  then xy  then oras  i think it would be easier to move forward rather than backward so that way they would nt have to unlearn certain game mechanics introduced later on 
3499,pokemon,frlghgssdpptbw really  anything recent
3500,pokemon,probably platinum
3501,pokemon,firered leafgreen tho unfortunately they are hard to find but they are simple best introduction with the help feature
3502,pokemon,honestly  the latest ones  and that ll always be my answer unless the latest ones are baaaaad
3503,pokemon,i feel like xy is a great start for new players 
3504,pokemon,i would nt start with anything from before gen iv because of the physicalspecial split maybe platinum  or bw1 
3505,pokemon,i d probably go black and white with its nice crop of original pokemon with no old pokemon showing up until the endgame  it saves people from that feeling that they need to know what all the pokemon leading up to that particular game are that kind of overwhelming feeling can be off putting for people new to the series so bw do a good job of mitigating that 
3506,pokemon,whatever the newest one is 
3507,pokemon,black amp  white gen 5 is large and varied  with a much better balance than gen 1 the games are challenging  but not frustratingly so the map is visually more interesting and better navigable than in any other game there is a lot to do beyond just beating the elite four and stopping the bad guys  including some truly epic legendary quests  comparable even with gen 3   there are natural sequels in black amp  white 2 which directly flow  both in terms of gameplay and story 
3508,pokemon,watchog watchog watchog watchog watchog watchog watchog watchog watchog watchog
3509,pokemon,klefki it was the reason i stopped playing competitively that swag play shit just ruined every battle nothing says fun like being unable to attack for turns while your mons kill themselves oh the joy 
3510,pokemon,ralts and its entire line  i loved ralts when i first played ruby way back when it was cute  and gardevoir was great  but i have hated ralts ever since oras came out i always associate ralts with wally  and wally drives me up the f    ing wall in oras he s annoying  and i get it  he s a shy kid  but seriously i ca nt stand him 
3511,pokemon,oddish especially in the older games  that damn poisoning
3512,pokemon,there s one pokemon that always annoys the shit out of me when i run into it  but i ca nt remember 
3513,pokemon,stunfisk he s less disgusting looking than garbodor  but that  ftttttbbb  noise he makes ugh  i hate stunfisk 
3514,pokemon,i ve been playing a lot of mystery dungeon lately  so it has to be aerodactyl  some context might be needed for this one in rescue team  there s a chain of missions in the postgame that ends by concluding a major plot point from before the credits one of these missions is to go through a dungeon called pitfall valley it s 25 floors long floors 2125 only have 1 pokemon spawning on them  aerodactyl aerodactyl has the pressure ability  forcing me to use up my moves twice as fast  when the game had been particularly unforgiving with max elixir distribution  and these particular ones carry supersonic and agility so these guys are essentially zubats on steroids and that s all there is for 5 floors  a distant second  due to the same game is gengar  but the reasons are rather spoilery so i wo nt say anything 
3515,pokemon,any high probability to appear poke in a route when i m searching for some specific poke it s just so tyring to face 100 staravia before finding an stunky in route 11  even dedenne which has a lower appear rate appeared to me sooner  edit  bad english
3516,pokemon,amoongus is ridiculously annoying competitively and ingame it s almost as if this pokemon was created to be despised spore is an 100  accurate move that puts you to sleep so that s annoying it has a boatload of other status effect moves to throw at you  but since it s a grasspoison type it ca nt be poisoned or spored itself it s bulky as hell and even if you do a chunk of damage to it regenerator lets it get a ton of its health back  synthesis if you re not careful also its main trait in the games are to fool you into thinking you re getting an item and then wrecking your team with statuses i seriously hate this thing 
3517,pokemon,walrein 90  accuracy sheer cold in the bmaison bulky enough to take a hit  then it nails you with a cheap ohko they made me ragequit a few times already 
3518,pokemon,fucking sigilyph and its movepool oh  you want to switch in something that had high base attack to take it out  psycho shift  surprise bitch  here s another 25 stat boost for defense that also doubles as an offensive 
3519,pokemon,wild graveler  who will survive your first attack with sturdy and then use explosion eats up all of your potions and other assorted healing items 
3520,pokemon,pelipper for some reason  whenever an aicontrolled one uses protect  it feels like it has a 100  success rate but maybe that s just me 
3521,pokemon,this list needs zubat remember mt moon   
3522,pokemon,i hated encountering ditto i always had to bring some lowleveled  easytocatch pokemon whenever i did nt it was extremely hard and annoying to catch 
3523,pokemon,gen i and ii dratini and dragonair wrap and thunderwave fuck them 
3524,pokemon,umbreon man fuck that thing it s so annoying in battle that it found its way to my least favorite pokemon spot 
3525,pokemon,wobuffet  guess 
3526,pokemon,dragonite fucking agiwrap man  most obnoxious strategy ever
3527,pokemon,good job channeling mucha on this  
3528,pokemon,i dunno  i think art nouveau would better fit characters like cynthia  diantha and wallace  flannery s more of the metal album cover type  p
3529,pokemon,fucking mega kangashan because i have nt figured out how to fucking beat it yet
3530,pokemon,ftil erika s sabrina s relative 
3531,pokemon,i really miss the old watercolor style of the artwork  this payed homage to it very well nicely done 
3532,pokemon,gaaah 11 more days
3533,pokemon,the brock wants to fight 
3534,pokemon,this is really cool  misty looks mean af great job as always  phil  
3535,pokemon,these are really well done  hats off to you 
3536,pokemon,this is so awesome  top stuff 
3537,pokemon,you colored these digitally  i d love to see your process on how you did the watercolor style in photoshop or whatever 
3538,pokemon,is brock related to bruno  they look very similar
3539,pokemon,i just can not get enough of the watercoloringsugomori style  great work 
3540,pokemon,is surge supposed to be french  edit  i m wondering because of the flag on his sleeve in the color version the colors are reversed of course  but in the sketch the shading seems like the french flag 
3541,pokemon,you did a great job bro  i loved the original designs then the remake kinda made them meh to me 
3542,pokemon,brock took a level in badass in this sketch i like it 
3543,pokemon,i like it you matched the art style very well at first i was a little confused and thought the work you did was just some art for gb era pokemon that i ve never seen 
3544,pokemon,you should look into sugimori s art in pokemon tcg i remember there was one with gym leader theme 
3545,pokemon,these are very well done  should do all of them and an elite four version too 
3546,pokemon,brock and erika are great  i really dont like misty s eyes and lr surge is just all around weird 
3547,pokemon,great 
3548,pokemon,very cool  since sugimori is nt doing that neat old watercolor style anymore  i m glad other people are picking up the slack there s something so dreamy about it i d actually love to see newer pokemon and trainers done this way too 
3549,pokemon, gt  tpci wants to celebrate 20th anniversary of series  gt  proceeds to take down fan videos which are part of that 20 year history and contain large amount of work  showing devotion and dedication to said series  gt  reaction by everyone not at tpci   wtf    
3550,pokemon,when  marriland     <URL>  is disappointed in you  you know you ve gone too far    wtfu 
3551,pokemon,tpc is getting even more draconian 
3552,pokemon,sad to be bitter in regards to pokemon during the year of its 20th anniversary  but this is some garbage the guy was a dedicated fan with beautiful works  and they take go after him in this of all years  wtfu

3554,pokemon,tpci is greedy as fuck  they ended 2015 by suing a fan who threw a pokemon themed party and agreed to taking down images which infringe upon their copyright and now they kick off 2016 by taking down this guys content great company 
3555,pokemon,its these types of things that make me wonder how far off we are from tpc just turning on their heels and saying  know what  fuck all of this   and then promptly tear down  insurgence  zetaomicron  pixelmon  pokemmo  etc etc  i ve been under the assumption they d be going after all of them at least a year or two ago it seems they re getting more rabid now unless its an officially sanctioned celebration of pokemon   fuck your fandom for us  we tell you when to say thank you 
3556,pokemon,can anyone explain to me how this is different from a cover and or why this is nt just your typical case of fair use 
3557,pokemon,i m curious if they pulled this down to make way for possible symphonic evolutions music 
3558,pokemon,should i mention that the man behind it pays money to the pokemon company to make their music 
3559,pokemon,how is this taken down but not pokemon showdown 
3560,pokemon, where s the fair use      <URL>  v  zvqfamotwai 
3561,pokemon,this is actually evil
3562,pokemon,i heard that there s this pok  mon holiday called  zangoose day  which is on march 9th  when did that start  why  who came up with it  do other pok  mon have their own  days   please send me a link that shows all the pok  mon holidays  any links that have more info on this would be appreciated 
3563,pokemon,this scares me i really want to make pokemon stuff someday for fair use  i wo nt even monetize it  and the fact that there s a chance that i will be annihilated really scares me 
3564,pokemon,that is so fucking creepy 
3565,pokemon,and bulbasaur is no where to be found shocking xd
3566,pokemon,for my curiosity  can someone tell me what videos this channel posted 
3567,pokemon,relevant    <URL>  v  zvqfamotwai
3568,pokemon,that could be a possibility his reasoning for not choosing to evolve it to jolteon  vaporeon  or flareon was because he liked it the way it is he did nt want to  make  it evolve he obviously cares a lot for his eevee  so perhaps it could ve happened eventually i guess we ll never know  personally though  i ca nt envision it evolving at all  sort of like an ash s pikachu thing  but if it were to evolve  it would be through friendship  espeon  umbreon

3572,pokemon,we all know z is coming in one form or another however we do nt know if we ll be getting a seventh generation yet if they made it for new 3ds only it would help sales dramatically 
3573,pokemon,how long does each drawing take you  approximately 
3574,pokemon,crystal mostly because it was the last to feature sugimori s artwork 
3575,pokemon,my partner was a shinx in sky  at first i thought it was female  then some guy here told me it was male  now it s female again  i do nt know what to believe
3576,pokemon,dear god
3577,pokemon,  <URL>  v  mlu0pf<SMILE>gbpu
3578,pokemon,i m sure ushinx_fucker considers this valuable information 
3579,pokemon,i ca nt think of anything greater for this picture than the substitute doll 
3580,pokemon,oh crap he s almost done 
3581,pokemon,15 days left 
3582,pokemon,hey  her name is caitlyn sphinx and she s an amazing  stunning  beautiful woman  totally not pc bro
3583,pokemon,skuntank  always felt like they should ve made the shiny black like a real skunk the pink honestly does nt look  terrible   but it just could ve been so much better also snot green ursaring is disgusting 
3584,pokemon,page doesnt load
3585,pokemon,x for me  i really like the colors and leaves on it 
3586,pokemon,mine is white and alpha sapphire 
3587,pokemon,i like then gen 1 art  old school sugimori artwork looks nice
3588,pokemon,i lost it at sawsbuck   bambi   bambi s dead mom 
3589,pokemon,i know it s played up for comedy  but it s a little sad that he glances over the whole point of team plasma they re not really bad guys  at least their cause   it s just that their leader is playing them for an evil scheme 
3590,pokemon,cant you counter claim this 
3591,pokemon,ash ketchum ash ketchum needs them all 
3592,pokemon,nintendo needs to get inline with 2016 and get their head out of their ass that is stuck in kyoto business sense
3593,pokemon,looks great mane
3594,pokemon,adorable  i love the textures and lines 
3595,pokemon,did nt he adjust his channel recently after talking with a lawyer so this would nt happen 
3596,pokemon,great work conceptually my two favorite pokemon 
3597,pokemon,smushed together like that they kinda look like monokuma 
3598,pokemon,reposting what utheunclebob put in the rnintendo thread  gt  i m just going to throw this out there  but tpc probably has some fairly highpaid lawyers anyone saying that tpc is in error or preo had the license to do this i d put  5 down that you re wrong i feel that  in some way  preo violated the exact terms of the license and thus  tpc put the hammer down it s possible they re mistaken  but that s a pretty huge mistake  gt  now  assuming we re hearing the whole story  they re being a     about it if tpc ca nt be contacted by preo  or  better yet  contact him before the legal action  to determine what the issues was and how to fix it  well  that s just s      of them  gt  as for youtube  they are not at fault if preo is in violation of his license agreement and tpc has logded a complaint  nothing youtube can do except comply it s the law and all  contrary to the gut reaction  tpci has done nothing but support the community with their actions lately  especially on the tcg side of things   and comes across as a much more progressive company to fan response than nintendo  this is really odd  and i have a feeling something behind the scenes is going on 
3599,pokemon,holy shit it does look like monokuma
3600,pokemon,does anyone know an the email address to contact tpci  i know it might not be much  but i do wonder what would happen if we sent emails en masse to them  the squeaky wheel gets the most attention as hey say  i m a long time fan  since the day the games came to america  and always loved the ip with a passion yet  i m also a future content maker  and issues like this rock me to my core it s pretty heartless to treat a dedicated fan this way  even when they are making you a small amount of money i ve been such a pokemon fan for so long  yet  i m really considering not buying anymore of their products over this this issue could affect me in the future in many ways  and how i wish to creatively express myself i think it s a real shame that the company is conducting it s self with such bullylike tactics  and that they are pushing around such a dedicated and loyal fan  i do nt usually hashtagbut  wtfu
3601,pokemon,beartic for wendy  kinda fits both the lumberjack and   coolice     spoiler  themes  spoilered in case someone has nt seen the finale yet 
3602,pokemon,this is such a cute idea  gravity falls is the best i think snorlax would be a good soos and if you want to incorporate red hair for wendy  what about blaziken  red colouring plus fighting type would be perfect  because she had a few badass moments throughout the series you could also use tepig for waddles i m not sure what pokemon would fit the other characters atm on a side note  alex visited game freak when he was in japan recently  so if there s not some sort of gf reference in a future pokemon game i will be very disappointed  p a couple of trainers named after gf characters  or perhaps a mabel style sweater or dipper s hat to dress your character in would be perfect 
3603,pokemon,had to look up the cipher wheel quick  i ve seen a good chunk of the show but forgotten what exactly the symbols were  crescent  lunatone  question mark  unown  haha jk that would be a horrible pick  ice bag  avalugg eyeball star  volcarona or solrock  llama  arceus  good luck with that team anyways this does nt look like an easy one to make the ones you picked already look pretty good for a theme team 
3604,pokemon,reposting an earlier comment i made on rnintendo  his update says that his licenses are for music downloads and streaming  but not for videos synced to the music he is now planning to reupload all the youtube stuff as 30second previews and shifting the full songs to spotify and apple music  from the video description  gt  to summarize the video  gt   tpci s intent for taking down kanto is still unclear  but regardless  gt   i do not have a sync license to upload whole compositions  or arrangements of those compositions  to youtube gt   as a result  it would be safest to remove all videos and move to streaming platforms gt   production on johto legends will continue after a 1month hiatus gt   the preo youtube channel will <URL> more like a promo platform gt   all music will be made available to stream on spotify and apple music gt  if you d like to continue streaming the kanto album  you may do so here  gt  spotify    <URL> gt  apple music    <URL> edit    tl  dr  he thinks he had the wrong licenses  so he does nt have permission to stream his music on youtube  
3605,pokemon,it looks like barney 
3606,pokemon,it s another one of those vivian type things that gets covered up by english censors 
3607,pokemon,i m rewatching the series and does anyone else think mikey s eevee would eventually evolve into slyveon 
3608,pokemon,granbull stan 
3609,pokemon,hey everyone  in honor of gf coming to a close i m trying to make a pokemon team with each pokemon referencing a different charterer on the cipher wheel  so far i though of  trevanent as dipper  pine tree  jirachi as mabel  shooting star  ambipom as ford  sixer ambipom has six fingers  and maybe snorlax as soos does anyone have any ideas on who to add or what to change  thanks guys 
3610,pokemon,awww  now i wish i would own explorers of the sky   shinx is so cute alas  i only have explorers of time 
3611,pokemon, i thought you looked familiar     <URL>  really great cosplay 
3612,pokemon,i really dug bellossom as a grass pokemon  because it was the first pure grass type that was nt shit  throwing shade at tangela   then i used it in pokemon stadium 2  and saw just how tiny bellossom really is and that turned me off from liking bellossom  
3613,pokemon,  <URL>
3614,pokemon,well that s pretty bellawesome  boom puns  edit  just ctrlf d bellawesome and realized this pun had been made twice already will not delete my shame 
3615,pokemon,really nice cosplay  i can tell you put a lot of work and care into it 
3616,pokemon,odd question but  how tall are you  
3617,pokemon,i looooove this even though vileplume is my fave  
3618,pokemon,bellossom just learned crisis vine  i m paralyzed and this chick is poison   lol haha damn im dumb 
3619,pokemon,i do nt know if i d necessarily consider that a cosplay  but it is an awesomely themed dress  and it looks great 
3620,pokemon,ctrlf bellawesome  ah i love the puns this sub makes neat work op 
3621,pokemon,the username seemed familiar and then i remember the poke ballroom dress gj op looks dope 
3622,pokemon,i like that it looks like you can wear out in a casual way  very nice 
3623,pokemon,1010 would water regularly 
3624,pokemon,those awkward teenage years where you re a slobbering mess  gloom 
3625,pokemon,very nice  not sexualized cosplay with random shit thrown in good on ya
3626,pokemon,i love this 
3627,pokemon,i truely love this cosplay  it s amazing and you did a great job doing my favorite pokemon 
3628,pokemon,after finishing super mystery dungeon  i decided to go back and play explorers of sky i like the cute pok  mon so i ve always picked either evee or vulpix this time  i googled all the evolution charts and decided shinx does nt get any less adorable and picked that through google i also found out that there are gender differences for this pok  mon  one of them being  gt  the hind paws are black on the male shinx and blue on the female  which does nt matter anyway  because only players who pick  male  can be shinx picture chart here    bulbapediabulbagardennetwikishinx_  pok  c3  a9mon   sprites  or so i thought i ve noticed that my hind feet are blue  i do nt mind  but i m supposed to be a male shinx with black feet plus  the black feet are way cuter than the blue feet   has anyone else noticed this  i took some pictures  but i do nt have any sort of capture card or high quality camera but just looking at it in person it s very obviously blue   full uncropped album     <URL>  amp   direct link to single pic collage     <URL>   made specially for other mobile users with low dataspeed   apologies for any formatting issues  posted on my phone  i also posted this in rmysterydungeon
3629,pokemon,love it ol  wobbuffet is the best 
3630,pokemon,nice to see people noticing little things like this 
3631,pokemon,best pokemon around    
3632,pokemon,that cosplay is bellawesome 
3633,pokemon, link to the pokemon center online shop     <URL>  so now that the pokemon center online shop in japan has opened  i think that we all want to go bananas with our money so as someone who lives in japan and knows japanese  i would like give everyone some simple information about it  now first of all  the shop contains all of the current products that are available in the physical pokemon center shops  excluding shop exclusive items   but in return  the online pokemon center has some limited goods of its own    1 shipping   the shipping   japan only   cost 540   jpy  for orders that are under 5000   orders over 5000  are free  the boxes comes in  custom pokemon cardboard boxes     <URL>  s  specialbox6290   it is also possible to choose gift wrapping if you pay an aditionall fee the shipping time is estimated to be 27 days    2 limited goods   there are several goods limited to the pokemon online center  including the extremely nice  kanto gym badge set     <URL>  s  specialakamidori2154   there are also ongoing campains  where if you use more than 5000   you will get a random  1 out of 3 filefolder     <URL>   the next campaign  lasting from 19th of march  to 22nd of april  will have a similar system but instead of filesfolders  you will get a random  1 out of 3 mug cup     <URL>  for those who shop at the online shop for the first time  will recieve a pikachu with fly and surf as moves the campaign will last until 22nd of may  and the serial code will be valid until 31st of august also  the code is only usable on japanese games  thanks umirukushake     3  point system     <URL>  s  specialpokepoint<SMILE>124    now the point system is where stuff gets interesting  1  of what you paid will <URL> something called pokepoints  meaning that 10 000  would be 100 pokepoints   those points can later be used to play minigames if you would win in the minigames  you win special goods now it is unspecified about what kind of minigames and what kind of goods one are able to win for the time being so we just have to wait for more information    4 account and how to buy   if you want to buy something from the website  you have to make an account for the website this is the tricky part  because to be able to make an account  you have to have a japanese adress and phone number on top of that  as mentioned before  it only ships inside japan  so how do you buy  you ask  if you dont have japanese friends or family  your best go to option would be to use a website called  tenso     <URL>   so what happens is that you set your shipping adress to tenso in japan so that they get the items they will then send the products to your home  personally  i have never used tenso  seeing as i have no need for it but i ve heard good stuff about the service from a close friend that uses it alot to shop on the japanese amazon  other than that  if you just want to browse  i ve made a  small translation on the search engine found on the website     <URL>   if there is something i forgot or something you were wondering about  please ask  and i will answer as fast as i can 
3634,pokemon,instead of tenso  i get mine through  sunyshore     <URL>   the owner is an american living in japan who s also a huge pokemon fan every time there s a new release of merch you can preorder it from there and they ship very quickly pricing is very reasonable imo 
3635,pokemon,before any questions crop up  tenso is fantastic as someone who has imported multiple figures  amiibo   from japan  tenso has been affordable and reliable 
3636,pokemon,oh boy  it s this  sylveon again  have nt seen them in a while 
3637,pokemon,um     lmao   
3638,pokemon,milotiptop design 
3639,pokemon,you look like a gym leader amazing work 
3640,pokemon,that is badass    super cool design   
3641,pokemon,ahhh  was this at katsucon this past weekend  i ca nt believe i did nt see you  you look amazing 
3642,pokemon,is this at the gaylord in the national harbor 
3643,pokemon,someone had their pok  blocks or poffins whatever you kids are into these days it looks great 
3644,pokemon,poison is nt calculating its ground weakness  also  it might be handy  if possible  to include a dropdown of all abilities that render attacks to do 0x  levitate  motor drive  water absorb  etc  to modify the resulting numbers since  for example  gengar does nt have the 2x weakness to ground unless it loses levitate or is fighting a mold breakerteravoltturboblaze mon 
3645,pokemon,this is awesome its helpful when you are on the go and ca nt remember  like me  what affects or does nt affect what 
3646,pokemon,wtf material
3647,pokemon,no thanks
3648,pokemon,that pole is going up his ass
3649,pokemon,great work but terrifying
3650,pokemon,hmm i m not so sure about this one 
3651,pokemon,looks like someone was at katsucon
3652,pokemon,awesome  i love the flowers in your hair 
3653,pokemon,and  that s  why hms are bullshit  d
3654,pokemon,i wish that they would just make it so that hms were inherent abilities that certain species could use naturally sort of like target clears in the ranger series 
3655,pokemon,rmildlyinfuriating
3656,pokemon,well  there s not a path now looks like you can go around 
3657,pokemon,more like belleawesome
3658,pokemon,that s extremely beautiful  good job
3659,pokemon,good cosplay  i like how you did a good job at pulling off the look without going overboard 
3660,pokemon,i always like imagineing my metagross using  agility  meteor mash  giga impact and earthquake 
3661,pokemon,needs more poof in the dress
3662,pokemon,he was my main wall back in gold version  gb  not ds  i never gave him back to his owner
3663,pokemon,wow  you look really beautiful in that 
3664,pokemon,thanks for having class
3665,pokemon,that s not a cosplay  that s just a dress s
3666,pokemon,swole
3667,pokemon,i thought you were doing zeldathon stuff 
3668,pokemon,i ll always remember shuckle as the one who single handedly shut down my hackmons run in the pokemon towersubway thing double teamed  toxic to take out my wonderguard sableye and sturdy negated my no guard high speed pokemons  sheer cold i was nt paying attention so i had no idea what had happened until it was too late 
3669,pokemon,adorable cosplay
3670,pokemon,gt  woah check out this extremely on time and early in the day valentines post wow can you believe it you guys gt  tagged  pokemon  pok  mon  sylveon  drawin  basically the mona lisa  wow okay    source      <URL> 
3671,pokemon,so we have a long running joke on the  rpokemon discord chat     discordgg0cccioyfdu<SMILE>vzwut  about getting one of the mods to dress up like a bellossom if it gets a mega evolution before vileplume does  congrats on providing the visual imagery for that costume   p also lovely costume   even if bellossom is a sinfully  happy abomination   
3672,pokemon,that s disgusting  lol  2014 is like a distant memory 
3673,pokemon,wowie  is nt competitive pokemon fun and diverse 
3674,pokemon, still more variety than vgc 2015     <URL> 
3675,pokemon,well that s dumb
3676,pokemon,how are most teams using two megas 
3677,pokemon,look at all the different teams 
3678,pokemon,jeeeesus christ every year i consider vgc but this shit just puts me off every single time i knew this was going to happen to be honest game freak  or whoevers in charge of the rules thought this was going to diversify things after the complete clusterfuck of fuckyoubirds and genies there were last year  landorustherian was on every single team in the masters division finals  but really all it s done is thrown groudon and deer into the mix of fuckyoubirds and megakhans and the worst part is  a team like this is going to win the world championships later this year  it s inevitable i get that using pok  mon with decent stats or a diverse moveset is very important  but creativity is just not there when it comes to vgc and it s really sad  it s like clone troopers playing fucking pok  mon we need more se jun parks in the world in the mean time i guess i ll either stick to battle spot and local unsactioned tournies  make a name for myself as a local legend instead of involving myself in matches of random varieties of the same 20 pok  mon or so jesus there s 706 fucking pok  mon we can use here people let s fucking use some shall we 
3679,pokemon,this  article     <URL>  on the tpci seems satirical after this post 
3680,pokemon,this is more diverse than early britain
3681,pokemon,the meta is pretty stablized too isnt it  wow that is really bad  only 1 and a half  i would consider team 5 different enough  teams are different since online patching is a thing  why doesnt nintendo try to balance the stats to promote a more healthy metagame 
3682,pokemon,that looks pretty fun 
3683,pokemon,seems like a good chunk of these teams are cheap as hell most have at least one mega  one legendary andor one primal
3684,pokemon,fastest way to beat your rival
3685,pokemon, souce  randowis     <URL> 
3686,pokemon,   sbbook  never mind that using dream eater when the opposing pok  mon is not asleep is a turn given away for gardevoir to use other moves like psychic
3687,pokemon,one of the scariest things i ve ever seen 
3688,pokemon,is there a website where i can go to look at the movesetsevivs  i m not familiar to pokemon so i do nt know where i could find it
3689,pokemon,so what are the cookiecutter builds for each of the mostly used pokemon   top 4 teams  would like to know what type of aspects to buildaim for a counter team  training for an <URL> regional 
3690,pokemon,but  uh gardevoirher trainer were nt asleep why did dream eater have any effect 
3691,pokemon,one team without talonflame one team without primal groundon  i d be more interested in these sorts of tournaments if the usedwaytoomuch pokemon were banned of course  there would just be eight more almost as good  pokemon that would take their place 
3692,pokemon,i am pretty sure that if they use giga impact there would nt be any path at all 
3693,pokemon,pokemart employee is a great job they make a fucking ton 
3694,pokemon,well obviously it would nt work  giga impact is normal  and thus not very effective against rock 
3695,pokemon,it s been a really long time but was nt shuckle the only pokemon that can do 999 damage without cheats 
3696,pokemon,bout to get shuckle fucked 
3697,pokemon,should shuckle get a mega evolution 
3698,pokemon,knock knock it s shuckles
3699,pokemon,in ruby  schuckle was by far my most favorite sidekick this bastard could nealry take any hit  and keep on ticking that baton pass was pure hell for those who would oppose me 
3700,pokemon,i love it  one of my favorite pokemon 
3701,pokemon,this is just awesome  accurate  adorable  and you pulled it off so well   
3702,pokemon,half of them are the exact same  assuming movesets follow  this is why we make our own rules in smogon 
3703,pokemon,rsmogoncirclejerk is going to be happy about all of these talonflames 
3704,pokemon,it seems mr glover likes to live dangerously 
3705,pokemon,these are the times i wish there were a double up vote option
3706,pokemon,that is friggen adorable 
3707,pokemon,  have any questions about pok  mon that you d like answered    if they re about the anime  the games  the manga  or  anything  pok  mon related  feel free to ask here  no matter how silly your questions might seem         a few useful sources for reliable pok  monrelated information     serebii     wwwserebiinetindex2shtml   bulbapedia     bulbapediabulbagardennetwikimain_page   smogon     <URL>  also remember to check  the rpokemon faq     <URL>  and our  related subreddits list     <URL>          if you want to answer questions posed by other members of the community  remember to sort the comments by new    if you use res  please also consider subscribing to this thread so you know when new questions are asked 
3708,pokemon,are there lgbt characters or pokemon 
3709,pokemon,sorry if this does nt belong in here  i am trying to make a viable rollout donphan  i was thinking rollout  metronome was a fun combo to begin with i also maximized def and sp def to keep the rollout going anyone have any useful tips for thisgt 
3710,pokemon,please can anyone suggest an ev spread for my catching gallade  i m thinking 252 atk  252 spd and 4 hp but should i go for something more defensive to endure legendaries 
3711,pokemon,how effective would running four imposter dittos with perfect hp iv  evs in casual double battles be  obviously i d be doing it for shits and giggles  but how effective would it honestly be 
3712,pokemon,my gamestop ran out of mew codes and so i found a very generous person to give me one online  but i do nt know how to actually download it any help 
3713,pokemon,is there a way to look at my pokedex online  i just bought a n3dsxl and pokemon x i joined the pokemon global link and did the game sync with my game are there any other supplementary things that i should do outside of the game 
3714,pokemon,where can i watch all seasons and full episodes of pokemon 
3715,pokemon,i recently went back to pokemon ruby omega and i have no idea where i am at in the story line ruby was by far the game i put the most time into  i m twiddling my thumbs on route 120 have been to lillycove i have strength  surf and fly  i remember on leaf green there was a summary of what i had done before  i dont know if you can do that on this game  please help 
3716,pokemon,i ca nt find any information on the <URL> pokemon title  is it actually coming out this year  what s the intel regarding this next title  will we find out on the 27th 
3717,pokemon,is anyone able to eli5 hidden abilities please  i read online that people look for pokemon with the ha that they want  but how do they know if it s hidden     thanks for any replies 
3718,pokemon,we need a video of your bellossom dance 
3719,pokemon,what are her iv sability 
3720,pokemon,great  bellossom has always been one of my favorite pokemon that never gets any love you really nailed the hula girl look that inspired the pokemon 
3721,pokemon,so cute 
3722,pokemon,it s got a meloetta  feel
3723,pokemon,1010 would awkwardly try to strike up conversation only to run out of interesting things to say 
3724,pokemon,that s bellawesome 
3725,pokemon,pokemon x btw  i m trying to finally iv train my slowpoke and get it maxed on health and defense mainly  but after hatching an entire box full  no ivs are getting better  how do i raise my pokemon s ivs so that i can breed to get the max ivs  im new to this so i have no idea what im doing
3726,pokemon,i have a question regarding pokebank  does anyone know how long pokemon is stored in pokebank s servers if you do nt renew your pokebank fee  i think i forgot to renew the fee  i do nt remember exactly when i bought the subscription  but i do remember being early february i can not access pokebank at my college dorm because for whatever reason my university s wifi works on everything but my 3ds  it would be nice to get vivillon forms as well as my living dex out of there as i spent a long time making them and i do nt want to see it all gone just because i have no wifi access on my 3ds and consequentially am unable to renew or take my pokemon out 
3727,pokemon,im breeding a ralts with a everstone  yet my pokemon is getting different abilities  ive read  in black 2 and white 2 the odds of passing down the nature of the parent holding an everstone is now 100   so whats the deal   playing on oras 
3728,pokemon,what s the most efficient way to get the eon ticket in oras  just leave my 3ds in sleep mode all the time and use the buzznav sync feature daily 
3729,pokemon,will pokemon bank be usable with the new blue  red  and yellow 3ds games 
3730,pokemon,for a player who s never owned a pokemon game  should i get oras or xy  everywhere i look has different opinions  so i would like to hear a few on here 
3731,pokemon,do you think you could help me get the pikachu via trade if i purchased something  it kind of sucks that it s limited to japan  
3732,pokemon,just some additional notes   there s currently a campaign running where all orders over 3000 yen have free shipping just ordered around  4000 worth of stuff and there was no shipping   the serial code for the pikachu can only be redeemed on japanese games   although the campaign for the pikachu technically runs until may  they may run out of cards before then depending on their supply   some retailers do refuse to ship package forwarding services like tenso  so before making a big order  you may want to wait until someone can confirm a successful order 
3733,pokemon,dang those badges are expensive and is there a web program to translate the site so i can make an account 
3734,pokemon,i believe that is my cue to gouge my eyes out 
3735,pokemon,you ca nt go wrong with pokemon brown  it s a classic and you should play it and try to find the hidden items because they ll be useful when pokemon prism comes along later  as for outside of that  both pokemon ashgray  play through original series anime events  and liquid crystal  gba goldsilver but also has a new story set in the orange islands  are quite amazing 
3736,pokemon,fire red omega i think it s better than the original 
3737,pokemon,ashgray all the way it s basically how i wanted to play pokemon ever since i was a kid i ve always wanted to mod it to replace the firered music with the anime music 
3738,pokemon,dont forget that orre and almia and all the other spinoff regions exist 
3739,pokemon,pokemon zetaomnicron and insurgenes are something else really <URL>  also the dark rising series 
3740,pokemon,hey all please remember that while it s totally fine to talk about roms and such here  you should nt link to them  that s against our rules thanks 
3741,pokemon,i liked ashgray bit i ca nt seem to find a good website to download it all of them spam me with pop ups 
3742,pokemon,snakewood and ashgray
3743,pokemon,seriously  why do these places insist on excluding the rest of the world  i m sure there is enough demand in the uk and eu to open a online store 
3744,pokemon,i am so excited  i had preregistered and everything with my tenso address i was looking for the dragonair and mew plush  but sadly they do not have either   
3745,pokemon,this is neat
3746,pokemon,hey guysgals  i made this watchface and wanted to share it s in facer format  a free app for android  and was designed for the moto 360  but will work with any android wear watch charmander s hp bar is used as the battery indicator let me know if you have any feedback  and if you ask reaaaally nicely  i ll take requests for other pokemon to see on the watch  please limit to fire red  leaf green so that my template will work  otherwise i ll need to make a new template  enjoy 
3747,pokemon,i have never played risk  but that looks really cool 
3748,pokemon,somehow i managed to only make up 4 territories  all of which are in kalos cause that place is big and empty   i tried my best to also make sure the territory connections made sense  like how  indigo plateau  can only be access by the much larger  victory road  or how the territories around snowpoint can only be reached by going through  north mt coronet   
3749,pokemon,would it be too big if you made a risk board of all the regions together 
3750,pokemon,do they ship to the states  edit  jk  read all the post it s late  
3751,pokemon,very cool  thank you very much for sharing this with us   d
3752,pokemon,is anyone willing to explain why each pokemon is picked so much 
3753,pokemon,there s a picture guide for those of you who are really interested in giving this a go but might struggle with japanese    <URL>
3754,pokemon,the weird thing is that gen 6 is so far the only generation that does nt have a 5<SMILE>0 bst trio 
3755,pokemon,i have been away from pokemon for a while it seems  who is the one on the left 
3756,pokemon,now we need is team charm posing like charlie s angels
3757,pokemon,oh god this makes me think about how they butchered the new opening 
3758,pokemon,am i the only one who thinks the new ones are dumb looking 
3759,pokemon,why do i read these things before bed  i hate crying myself to sleep cause i get tears in my ears 
3760,pokemon,terrifying from every angle
3761,pokemon,powerpuff pokemons
3762,pokemon,what s the one on the left supposed to be 
3763,pokemon,damn i totally forgot about that show s outro song so now i ll have that stuck in my head all day are you satisfied op  also made me remember  signal in the sky     <URL>  v  iuyrqixu250   which is still just as catchy as i remember it 
3764,pokemon,mankey jojo is canon 
3765,pokemon,oh god my insides the pain 
3766,pokemon,what happened to chalk 
3767,pokemon,my heart broke in two like that berry dizzy and the wild zigzagoon shared q_q
3768,pokemon,ou and uber galore  thank god i did nt participate this year 
3769,pokemon,good lord   
3770,pokemon,man  why is someone chopping onions in my philosophy lecture 
3771,pokemon,  <URL> i reordered some teams so it looks nicer 
3772,pokemon,i came here to laugh  not to feel 
3773,pokemon,i am old  there was once upon a time where i used no  gmb to play pokemon blue pick that turtle  learnt its name  and then play on that yellowish background for hours  try to go under a truck to get a stupid pokemon  learn all their names  etc  now i have no idea what i am looking at 
3774,pokemon,would help if the gardivoir was asleep that trainer is not going anywhere close to being champion 
3775,pokemon,holy hell that s disturbing
3776,pokemon,aaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  breath  aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh 
3777,pokemon,bloody hell
3778,pokemon,  sobs quietly
3779,pokemon,holy shit man tenouttaten
3780,pokemon,mew used scary face 
3781,pokemon,rip dizzy 1 like  1 prayer
3782,pokemon,it was actually specifically clarified by an npc  they do nt actually faint they just do nt have enough energy to do their usual thing they can still cut trees n shit
3783,pokemon, source  randowis     <URL> 
3784,pokemon,using  dead  and  fainted  in the same comic 
3785,pokemon,this is really a stupid comic 
3786,pokemon,it would be super cool if several hm moves could be substituted for another move that makes sense in the context 
3787,pokemon,that tyranitar s hissy fit at the first panel is hilarious 
3788,pokemon,wait  mega quaza was allowed and he s not on every team 
3789,pokemon,at this point smogonbird is looking more like vgcbird it s the only pok  mon in the top 6 that was used by everyone 
3790,pokemon,this is a strong piece of fan art right here
3791,pokemon,that is one beautiful drawing 
3792,pokemon,that looks amazing 
3793,pokemon,hoopa looks unchanged 
3794,pokemon,azelf  uxie  and mesprit are sad now 
3795,pokemon,have my upvote for a sweet story  here s to hoping it rises to the top  loved it 
3796,pokemon,hey  i m the artist of this picture thanks for linking back to my tumblr  i m really glad to hear so many people have enjoyed it 
3797,pokemon,that s sweet
3798,pokemon,i m actually excited for the xyz theme song  you can hear parts of in the trailer 
3799,pokemon,i m just pissed that they changed it to 7am i had a hard enough time getting up to watch it at <SMILE>am  but 7 is ridiculous 
3800,pokemon,i d also accept   if another girl tried to take you  i d wooper ass 
3801,pokemon,you know  like in zelda also i have no idea what is going on in this picture or what it says   source     <URL> 
3802,pokemon,da da da daaa 
3803,pokemon,hypno  it ai nt eating my dreams
3804,pokemon,the last thing i need is a big ass wailord chilling in my hood 
3805,pokemon,any of them they could all kill the shit out of you 
3806,pokemon,that s not gon na stop me from ice punching you anyways 
3807,pokemon,i started playing on gen 5  so i m biased towards than generation  victini is my favorite pokemon 
3808,pokemon,i ll do all  since i love every region kanto  charizard johto  cyndaquillugia hoenn  sceptile sinnoh  infernape unova  oshawott kalos  greninja  my favourite  seems  like i really love starters  p
3809,pokemon,fifth and volcarona  but i might as well do the other generations as well  first  beedrill or gengar second  scizor third  breloom fourth  gallade or roserade sixth  greninja or pangoro
3810,pokemon,gen 2 will always be special for me but my overall favourite pokemon was always onix 
3811,pokemon,might as well do every gen for this gen 1  cloyster gen 2  furret gen 3  flygon gen 4  tie between porygonz  torterra  and magnezone gen 5  tie between volcarona and escavalier gen 6  greninja
3812,pokemon,gen 4 and infernape 
3813,pokemon,gen 3  rayquaza  kyogre  groudon  imo  the weather trio is by far the best designed legendary trio 
3814,pokemon,gen 5  as it s almost always been shit on from day one and i have this silly underdog complex in addition to actual thinking gen 5 has good stories and pokemon and areas and shit  may be my fave pokemon gen  as for favorite  i have many if starters  then tepig because it reminds me of home if not starters lilligant is my aesthetic archeops has been the most surprisingly powerful in my ingame team though i ve actually used it so hm 
3815,pokemon,gen 4  porygonz
3816,pokemon,gen 3 amp  skitty 
3817,pokemon,gen 2  ampharos  special mention to gen 5 and scraggyscrafty though  they re a close second 
3818,pokemon,generation 1  electabuzz generation 2  scizorumbreon
3819,pokemon,1 squirtle
3820,pokemon,i ll just do all the generations because i ca nt decide on just one  gen i  vaporeon gen ii  totodile gen iii  swampert gen iv  floatzel gen v  zebstrika gen vi  goodra
3821,pokemon,generation 3  flygon 
3822,pokemon,i m torn between gen 45  but 5 has the better mons  my favorite of which is golurk might as well do the other generations  kanto  tentacruel johto  lanturn hoenn  manectric sinnoh  gliscor unova  golurk kalos  malamar
3823,pokemon,my favourite gen is 5  and i guess my favourite from that region would have to be serperior i picked him in both w and w2 and loved him so much  for the other regions  kanto  alakazam johto  crobat hoenn  gardevoir sinnoh  magnezone kalos  chesnaught
3824,pokemon,1 starmie 2 houndoom 3 none   4 luxrayempoleon 5 chandelurelilligant 6florges
3825,pokemon,i ll do it by regions as well kanto mega beedrill or marowak if megas do nt count  johto espeonscizor hoenn mega altaria or breloom sinnoh gallademega gallade tied with froslass  top faves  unova samurott  i m not a fan of unova at all  kalos tyrantrum
3826,pokemon,using fly while your pok  mon was fainted was one of the weirder things when playing red for the first time 
3827,pokemon,so many but beedril is probably at the top of my list because i am terrified of bees  plus it s probably the most likely no pokemon that i could end up finding around here since there are no cemeteries within several miles for pokemon like litwick and co  no oceans for things like jellicent or tentacruel  etc but there are always so many wasps every fall shedninja is scary  yes  but they are nt aggressive like beedril  and vespiqueen are probably fairly chill as long as you do nt hurt their hive or their combees  also they do nt appear to have stingers  
3828,pokemon,i think mr mime is the creepiest
3829,pokemon,mr bonding
3830,pokemon,hypno in the episode where he uses hypnosis and the kids think there pokemon and the adults just do nt care
3831,pokemon,as much as i like hypno  i d have to say it s the creepiest because  there once was an incident in which it took away a child it hypnotized   also  yamask because it  carries a mask that used to be its face when it was human  amp   sometimes they look at it amp  cry   that sounds more sad than creepy  but the thought of a human dying amp  <URL> a miserable pok  mon is quite unsettling 
3832,pokemon,  orig05deviantartnet7c6df201325272attack_on_titan__mr_mime_by_zsparkyd6los0djpg  whoops  who  put  this  here
3833,pokemon,mega bannette
3834,pokemon,litwick line s dex entries to me i like the pokemon designs themselves  but what they do 
3835,pokemon,machamp i have bad experiences with being suplexed
3836,pokemon,delcatty it has black eyes with vertical  white  slitted pupils it is demonic
3837,pokemon,lol 
3838,pokemon,i have nt played any johto games yet  so i ca nt really say  but i really like hoenn  and my favorite pokemon are mostly from that region my top 3 pokemon aside from politoed are lotad  jirachi  and kecleon 
3839,pokemon,hands down  sinnoh region pokemon s a lot harderbut winners probably glaceon
3840,pokemon,kanto  squirtle johto  lanturn  favorite pokemon  not region though  hoenn  mudkip  this is probably my favorite region  sinnoh  um torterra  i guess i was nt a fan of sinnoh  unova  dewott for sure  kalos  froakie
3841,pokemon,gen 1 and cubone pokemon blue was the first game in the series i played and i always related to cubone as a kid  as a matter of fact i still have a plush of him in my room now that i m in my early twenties 
3842,pokemon,kanto  pikablu jk lapras johto  mareep hoenn  flygon sinnoh  shinx unova  lilligantwhimsicott kalos  espurr
3843,pokemon,gt  there lived a pok  mon in a forest  in the forest  the pok  mon shed its hide to sleep as a human  awakened  the human dons the pok  mon hide to roam villages  i m gon na go with zoroark it could be anyone 
3844,pokemon,most definitely oras and torchic
3845,pokemon,the first pok  mon game i played was fire red but the first game i first purchased was sapphire that being said gen 4 is my favourite it was the first game that all my friends and i played favourite pok  mon would be spiritomb 
3846,pokemon,gen 2  really the gen 4 remakes   quilava
3847,pokemon,golbat s gen 1 sprite creeped me out so much as a child
3848,pokemon,hypno
3849,pokemon,espurr freaks me out sometimes 
3850,pokemon,you saying about mrmime being creepy reminded me of this   <URL>
3851,pokemon,this is awesome 
3852,pokemon,gt    <URL> gt  bulky death fodder yep  sounds like boba fett 
3853,pokemon,you should go post this on rstarwars as well
3854,pokemon, inspiration     <URL>  w362h407nc 
3855,pokemon,new desktop bg  thanks
3856,pokemon,how did he make that helmet 
3857,pokemon,  orig02deviantartnet7476f2015114c2jesus_christ_how_horrifying_by_dadonyordeld<SMILE>quibipng
3858,pokemon,it s beautiful
3859,pokemon,0ctus you sick fuck
3860,pokemon,this is actual perfection the huge chart i ve been using forever is so hard on the eyes 
3861,pokemon,shoutouts to joohwan for that lilligant though
3862,pokemon,awesome   
3863,pokemon,yes 
3864,pokemon,my god  this is absolutely brilliant 
3865,pokemon,such diversity many excitement
3866,pokemon,much awesome   
3867,pokemon,so should i watch evangelion or what 
3868,pokemon,truly genius
3869,pokemon,oh god put the truck back
3870,pokemon,i think this is he cleverest crossover cosplay i ve ever seen 
3871,pokemon, also this     <URL> 
3872,pokemon,looks like judge dredd more than boba fett 
3873,pokemon,what was the first pokemon game you ever played  mine was crystal version on the gbc that s why totodile s my favorite pokemon  because it was my first 
3874,pokemon, that s awesome 
3875,pokemon,it makes even less sense when the rock s actually a geodude you can use pretty much any move to beat them in a battle  but apparently you have to hit them with rock smash first for some reason 
3876,pokemon,this is a masterpiece 
3877,pokemon,you ca nt get anymore clever than this 
3878,pokemon,do you think there is a regional pokedex which can be completed without help from a guide  starting with gen ii  in generation i  i think you could complete the pokedex without any walkthrough  various people in the game told you clues about evolutionary stones  evolution by trade  and the legenday pokemons where in places you were naturally led to explore the rarest pokemons were the safari ones i think  but with a little patience you could catch them the legit way  but starting with generation ii  some evolution methods were impossible to guess  held items while trading  happiness  albeit you could max this one without knowing about it  just by levelingup   so i think a walkthrough may be compulsory to complete the jotoh pokedex  generation iii is yet again a step in the cryptic direction  unless you re lucky  there s no getting a shedinja without outside help the 6tilesfeebas is yet another  <URL>  moment  not mentioning his convoluted evolution method and finally  i do nt think there s any trainer in the game using a chimecho  making it impossible to locate with the pokedex perhaps the regiriddle can be solved by a determined player  ca nt say myself as i was using a guide back then  right now i m finally playing gen iv  and i ve advanced the sinnoh pokedex as much as i can all alone  because i love discovering things by myself  but i fear i might soon have to search for answers on internet  as i m having difficulties with quite a number of pokemons  so i was wondering  is it even possible to complete a regional pokedex without a kind of guide  trading is authorized for evolution and versionexclusive pokemons purposes only has any of you been stubborn enough to complete a regional pokedex by yourself  without external help  mythical pokemons are out of the equation  because they are not needed to get the diploma 
3879,pokemon,mainly for confirmation  on my pearl version  i still have 3 boxes filled with pokemon i want to put in my y and omega version to do that  all i d need is a blackwhite2 version and use the pokebank  right  and i still have a cloned kyogre from the original sapphire  would that one make it inside the pokebank as well 
3880,pokemon,what is the in game differences between a fake and real gen 3 game  why should i care 
3881,pokemon,okay  so i m very new to breeding but after watching some youtube videos  i decided to try to breed a decent iv squirtle with a couple of egg moves for pratice  a couple of hours later and i have a modest blastoise  egg moves at hand  with the following iv s  31  31  31  31  30  31 i do nt even know the odds of that happening  but i m very happy with it  the downside  it s ability is torrent instead of rain dish is it worth finding another person with a rain dish squirtle and rebreeding for a squirtle with decent iv s and rain dish  or should i count my lucky stars and use what i have  what are the odds of rolling similar stats  if there s any mathematicians out there  i m not sure what to do haha 
3882,pokemon,i m playing black version and i m trying to ev train this is my first time ev training and i think i ve done something horribly wrong i did look up how it works  but i guess i misunderstood something  pokemon give points towards evs  i m training against watchog and tranquill  so 2 points for each pokemon  and ducklett  which is 1 point each  and evs are divided by four to make the stat go up  macho brace doubles the ev points gained  i wrote this all down as i went  keeping a tally  so i knew exactly what was going on can someone tell me where  exactly  i went wrong  i gave my ferroseed 1 protein  10 muscle wings that s 5 attack ev  right  ferroseed is holding macho brace it defeated twelve ducklett and eight tranquillwatchog with macho brace  that s 6 hp ev  and <SMILE> attack ev  so when ferroseed leveled up  just now   it should have got 13 attack and 6 hp  at least  not accounting for ivs  but it got 2 attack and 2 hp did i just waste four hours chasing down wings and fighting pokemon  what went wrong  why did nt it work 
3883,pokemon,i m not sure how people are saying this confirms z  but i am hyped for the anime in english 
3884,pokemon,yeaah  looking forward to it  we should commend how quickly they dub the anime  some animes take like 12 years just to get dubbed 
3885,pokemon,the localized opening sounds so meh 
3886,pokemon,the theme from japan is a lot better  p i honestly just watch this sub 
3887,pokemon,the end tho  got ta catch em  all 
3888,pokemon,i lose braincells when i read youtube comments  so please do nt 
3889,pokemon,holy mackerel 
3890,pokemon,how many people here have gameboy carts of rby where the battery has nt died yet and the save data is intact  i m wondering if it s worth trying to find mine  but it s close to 17 years old now 
3891,pokemon,whats the best way to go about trading for exclusives from other games  i have omega ruby and am aiming at a living dex at some point in the future
3892,pokemon,damn pokemon is turning into power rangers  just rehashing the original theme song with some edits and a shitty guitar tune  i miss  born to be a winner     <URL>  v  d3jq_rqawqw    unbeatable     <URL>  v  l0t0orzr5d4    battle frontier     <URL>  v  1ha6ydkisc    battle cry  stand up      <URL>  v  pq<SMILE>piqbybjq    heroes     <URL>  v  jt_u9qr_npc   and while bw sucked  rival destinies     <URL>  v  10rubk4lwpo  is ok 
3893,pokemon,thought <SMILE>am was early for pokemon  try 7am now  crap  that s early and i do nt even think most kids are going to be awake and watching on tv or tablet at that time 
3894,pokemon,meh i guess that pretty much confirms z as the next game  hope they atleast add the same amount of new pokemon like they did in xy  was hoping more for a new gen at this point 
3895,pokemon,did i get a fake mewtwo  some random japanese guy traded his mewtwo for my lucario i think he did it on accident could it be fake 
3896,pokemon,i guess this confirms z as the next game to be released with the new graphic for the letter z and the emphasis on it  not that  that should surprised anyone at this point personally still waiting on the  hey you pikachu 2  announcement 
3897,pokemon,going to z before the game even drops  hmm 
3898,pokemon,what s the song at around the 1<SMILE>  50 mark in pokemon xyamp  z 11  it s really sweet and i would love to hear the full version 
3899,pokemon,oh come on 
3900,pokemon, source     <URL> 
3901,pokemon, it s not very effective 
3902,pokemon,holy fuckle here comes shuckle
3903,pokemon,good ole shuckles here 
3904,pokemon,for me i have to say when you get to kanto in hgss  there is a guy  near the south end of silent bridge  that says  bow down before my regal pokemon   the first two pokemon  a level 29 nidoking  your pokemon should be about level 59 by now  and a level 29 slowking  are pretty normal but oddly low level then he throws out a level 65 magikarp  i got really confused  but it was an easy battle so i do nt really care 
3905,pokemon,that couple with cloyster and onix 
3906,pokemon,you re hot  but brock is hotter
3907,pokemon,black belt igor  battle  despair  train 
3908,pokemon,that swimmer who appears in xy and the oras demo the one who  after you beat him in the demo  says he s going to swim all the way to kalos he then appears in xy  which is his first appearance to us  but for him inuniverse it s 10 years later  and tells you he just finished swimming from hoenn  this guy spent 10 years of his life swimming from one continent to another during the events of gold and silver  diamond and pearl  and black and white  or their counterparts in the mega evolution timeline  whatever they may be   this guy was just swimming along 
3909,pokemon,n do i need to explain   also  the  hiker  that  goes  with  you  on  the  ferris  wheel
3910,pokemon,does the trainers in vietnamese crystal count 
3911,pokemon,n
3912,pokemon,the fisherman with 6 magikarp he s in like literally every game and it s at the most inopportune time too he changes his name in different games because he does nt want to be recognized as  magikarp man  to the mockery of his fellow fishermen 
3913,pokemon,i was always a fan of the random emolgadedenne npcs in lumiose   you know  my emolga really wants to shock your dedenne   what  
3914,pokemon,morty  because he s just too hot for pokemon 
3915,pokemon,what did totodile do with kangaskhan s baby   d  anyways  nice job   d
3916,pokemon,there is a bug catcher in the viridian forest in hgss with a level 60 metapod that only knows harden
3917,pokemon,youngster joey  that kid has no friends except for you
3918,pokemon,it is definitely mr bonding in xy for me this guy is meeting 10 year olds all over kalos in motels and giving them opowers  this guy is a creeper for sure  edit  i guess he is not a trainer that we know of so it does nt really fit in this post but he s weird   he s weird 
3919,pokemon,what is it from 
3920,pokemon,magcargo  i do nt want to melt 
3921,pokemon,shedinja is the scariest thing ever irl once you read the dex
3922,pokemon,oh such  original  teams  this is sad 
3923,pokemon,soulsiverheartgold and sentret
3924,pokemon,gen 5  either scolipede or scrafty 
3925,pokemon,gen 1 is my all time favourite  and so gengar gets my vote 
3926,pokemon,lots of smeargles 
3927,pokemon,hey thats my favorite water type  the costume looks awesome too  
3928,pokemon,i ca nt remember which candle pokemon it was that uses human souls as fuel for its flame  and haunts hospitals looking for dying souls  banette was a discarded doll who is constantly seeking revenge on the child who abandoned it  dusknoir acts as a radio transmitter receiving messages from the world of the damned it is constantly hearing those voices ask it to bring new souls 
3929,pokemon,wobbafett for president  3
3930,pokemon,i m sad to say that it took me a second to put two and two together 
3931,pokemon,so  what s next  obidoof kenobi  han ludicolo 
3932,pokemon,i liked the team with kangaskhan in it
3933,pokemon,the best countyhunter
3934,pokemon,words can not describe how much i love this
3935,pokemon,as someone unfamiliar with the competitive scene  can someone explain why these particular pokemon are that much better than any other  especially talonflame and smeargle  
3936,pokemon,more please 
3937,pokemon,i saw alphonse  now i ca nt unsee it 
3938,pokemon,the worst part is that this is still more diversity than worlds had 
3939,pokemon,well  at least genies are no longer an issue 
3940,pokemon,okay this is actually exactly what i ve been wanting for years so simple and straightforward no giant chart to stare at just push the type button and up pops the results 
3941,pokemon,i just saw that it does nt work quite right on firefox  i ll look into it  edit  works now
3942,pokemon,this is pretty cool
3943,pokemon,this honestly got scarier the more i looked at it  to the point that i could nt even finish 
3944,pokemon,squidward mew
3945,pokemon,reminds me of dobby
3946,pokemon,here s 20 photos  in case one just did nt do the scarfactor justice 
3947,pokemon,no  what did you do to mew s cuteness    great work though 
3948,pokemon,that looks kinda weird
3949,pokemon,christ
3950,pokemon,why did you put the stick   there    you could have at least curved it from behind 
3951,pokemon,no why
3952,pokemon,why does this sub hate vgc so much  obviously no matter what format is set people will always use the best pokemon available what they mean by strategically diverse is that there are so many different viable sets you could use for each mon 
3953,pokemon,it s worth noting that there was a  heated     <URL>  discussion about the presence of dark void smeargle in the metagame  to the point that a ban could be seriously considered the very head of competitive game  chris brown  not rihanna s ex  just a name coincidence  intervened in that thread and announced they would recopile info about smeargle s usage and success during these regionals  to make a decision so  several competitive players agreed to carry smeargle to show how op it was 
3954,pokemon,welp glad this was the year i got too busy for comp sigh  i miss 2014 s meta heck  even 2015 s meta had room for more eccentric teams but this year  bleurgh 
3955,pokemon,fuck smeargle 
3956,pokemon,i am surprised how similar these teams are  when compared to my  single 6v6 od course  old uber teams  lol 
3957,pokemon,this is my favourite part about the vgcs you ll have little to no diversity almost all the way up to the worlds  and then suddenly the floor will open up with teams many of these people have been putting together for months after figuring out the kinds of things to combat what they d been running since january  there are always teams that have additions straight out of left field  and it makes for a friggin hype and surprising series of match ups at worlds 
3958,pokemon,edward glover s the only one with a somewhat unique team  and even he still has cresellia  which 3 others used  and talonflame  which 6 others used   he only had 4 unique pokemon  next place is joohwan kim with 2 unique pokemon after that  there are no more unique pokemon

3976,pokemon,inb4 it s to the clink line as diancie is to carbink
3977,pokemon,no gen 7 yet boys
3978,pokemon,idk about you  but  mahgearna  just sounds wrong i ll just call it  mahgiarna   sounds so much better 
3979,pokemon,the problem is the 6 pokemon per team rule as soon they added legendaries this rule was retarded they are kinda forced to take the same pokemon to cover enough  i think they should increase it to 12 pokemon per box  and 6 pokemon in battle this would make the fights by far more intersting and less rng luck based the thing is currently get one counter death and you win the game groudon without a hard counter is unstopable same goes for xerneas and kyogre 
3980,pokemon,i have a shiny shuckle named the tick  he s unshuckwitable 
3981,pokemon,i ll probably still call it magiana tbh
3982,pokemon,i have one na code for mew to give away to win  you must simply tell me the correct answer to this question  what is the sum of the first 5 weird numbers  good luck  edit  math solved  code gone
3983,pokemon,it just being a mythical kills alot of hype for me i thought we might get gen 65 it s hard to get excited for a pok  mon that will only be distributed at events  especially when this gen already had 3 of them
3984,pokemon,must have seen all the reddits and forums talking about manginas
3985,pokemon,sounds much better now 
3986,pokemon,heeeeeeey magearna 
3987,pokemon,so glad it no longer sounds like mangina 
3988,pokemon,everyone talking about how the new name is so much better so much worse  but it s exactly the same name 
3989,pokemon,it looks like the two ear appendages could possibly double as her dress and complete the pokeball sphere 
3990,pokemon,do nt fuckle with shuckle 
3991,pokemon,man reading these comments i need to go back to pokeacademy
3992,pokemon,dude looks like he s straight out of an adventure time episode 
3993,pokemon,im sure this is someones kink
3994,pokemon,i ve been looking into a lot about pokemon go and have had some good conversations on how my friends think that the game will be handled will there be fishing for water pokemon  will there be gym leaders of some sort  either real people  or characters waiting in some football stadium somewhere   could and elite four exist that can battle throughout the world instead of p2p will there be a team rocket  and even worse  can we lose our pokemon to them   how difficult will it be to catch some of the rarer pokemon and where might they be found  so  lets discuss 
3995,pokemon,i d like to see  like the games  not many fully evolved pokemon are available you d need to raise the lower evolution ones 
3996,pokemon,i m down as long as it is nt locked to just gen 1 pokemon
3997,pokemon,by having expectations for features  you are setting yourself up to be disappointed 
3998,pokemon,the hiker that says he likes kid trainers and then enters a double battle with a youngster 
3999,pokemon, magikarp s japanese name is koiking and its ventral and dorsal fins are little crowns     bulbapediabulbagardennetwikimagikarp_  pok  c3  a9mon     it s probably meant to be a joke that has nt translated that well  then again  the three kingswise men in the nativity can also be called magi  so maybe it s a bit more subtle   anyway  to answer the question  n weirds me out 
4000,gameofthrones,i have a theory that there are too many theoretical theories going around  how s that for a theory 
4001,gameofthrones,they ve all killed each other without acknowledging the  real  enemy amassing north of the wall that s why it s called a  game  of thrones 
4002,gameofthrones,this is a reminder that theories still need to be tagged in this thread this post has an  all spoilers  title warning  but no  theory  warning spoilers from the books and show are fine without tags  but    major theory comments need green speculation spoiler tags       <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide   if you are unsure how to tag your comment  the  spoiler guide     <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide  has examples of the markup you can use   i am a bot  and this action was performed automatically please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   <URL>  to  rgameofthrones  if you have any questions or concerns 
4003,gameofthrones,stark does nt matter they have plot armor they will win  tullytullys seem tight with the stark  sooo yeah arrynthey are screwed baratheon there s still gendry  edric storm and mya stone tyrell margaery is probably safe  but it is entirely possible that the tarlys decide to take over martellspretty safe lannistermany many lannisters left  are you forgetting greyjoys  gt  and well  house targaryen does not even has lands at this point maybe dany could get along with the martells and take dragonstone and the stormlands but for now they re not part of the seven kingdoms  there is no way the matrells could ger along with dany after quentyn aegon has the stormlands 
4004,gameofthrones,i could and would argue that the seven great houses are still in tact meaning they could be a stronger bond than the realm itself living through this rebellion and that  including ww   not saying this is the end game  as i m sure some will actually see its  line end but just a thought  for the moment at least 
4005,gameofthrones,daenerys does own lands  meereen  i think
4006,gameofthrones,stannis could still be alive 
4007,gameofthrones,there s also the lannisport lannisters if the main family falls  jamie cersei etc  then the lannisport lannisters will most likely take control of casterly rock starks obviously look fucked now but of course they re the protagonists of the show so they ll be back as for the tully s someone commented saying they ll be alright because they re tight with the starks but idk i could see george fucking them over  its thrones and the good guys do nt always win but the blackfish is a huge badass and could keep them going baratheons are so fucked unless some of the bastards get legitimized the arryns are pretty fucked too

4014,gameofthrones,then some little shit comes and wrecks it 
4015,gameofthrones,i love this piece of art  this is official art by michael komarck it s used for the  sansa stark card     <URL>  in the a game of thrones lcg 20  and maybe for other things too 
4016,gameofthrones,is that is that someone lying  frozen   behind sansa 
4017,gameofthrones,maybe i ve read too much fanfiction  but did we ever find out what they did with robb s head after joffrey threatened to serve it to sansa at his wedding 
4018,gameofthrones,after watching the teaser i got 2 ideas  1 is it possible that the characters we saw in the house of black and white will actually end up dying  if not this season maybe by the end of the show  2 what if the characters that are missing there are the ones that will die by the end of the season  as far as i know we didnt see ramsay and roose and its fair to say they are 2 candidates to die by the end of the season maybe the show producers could pull some  reverse psychology  type of thing on the viewers  this are just 2 cheap ideas i have and probably everybody had already i just wanted to know if we can make anything out of them  maybe figure something out  thanks for reading and have a nice day 
4019,gameofthrones,robert strong after teaser i was thinking what if all those people in teaser would come back from dead  and i was thinking how zombie joffrey would have those   blue bloody eyes      <URL>  that he got while dying and then i remembered who also have blue bloody eyes    robert strong      vignette4wikianocookienethieloyfuegoimages33crobert_strong_hbojpgrevisionlatest  cb  2015061516304<SMILE>  joffrey s eyebrows and skin colour also matches robert strong s more than   that dwarf that was brought to cersei      vignette2wikianocookienetgameofthronesimagesddb503_dwarf_1_oppo_headjpgrevisionlatest  cb  20150427005416  also if you would create a monster zombie  what better combination can you find than head of psycho king and body of a world s strongest man this is my   head   cannon now
4020,gameofthrones,nah  its the mountain  it is so obvious i cant even understand why people who watch the tv series have any other theory people who read the books might have a theory or two but not the show watchers only 
4021,gameofthrones,plus 10000 bravo   bravo

4031,gameofthrones,i think that whether you re a lord or not is dependent on the land that your family owns if a knight or his family owns land to govern  then he s a lord just remember that just because the knight was born to a noble family  it does nt necessarily make the knight a lord

4036,gameofthrones,all white walkers look the same to me
4037,gameofthrones,wow good catch 
4038,gameofthrones,that s the fucking  time warner cable logo     <URL> 
4039,gameofthrones,it s a different one  i had the same idea on my 1st watch of the episode  but on the second watch  i noticed it was a different one you can pick up the difference from his facial features and how he moves  body language 
4040,gameofthrones,gt  the black gate is made of weirwood with a face on it the face is old  pale  shrunken  and wrinkled with white eyes the door glows  when someone approaches the black gate  the eyes open then the door asks   who are you   a man of the night s watch must repeat a part of his vow   i am the watcher  realms of men  the door will open then  saying   then pass  is nt that proof that magic clearly exists in westeros  why many smart characters do not believe in magic  other than dragons   tywin straight out denied the possibility of magic at work when renly got assassinated tyrion was nt much of a believer either or at the minimum  they believe magic is long gone but there s still a talking door   and tyrion has been to the wall  i doubt this talking door is being kept as a secret by the night s watch 
4041,gameofthrones,you forget that we see the entire story  where characters only see it from their own view

4043,gameofthrones,well that s adorable 
4044,gameofthrones,i love this so much
4045,gameofthrones,this is actually really good something about it makes me feel happy 
4046,gameofthrones,is that a paw on the ground  did finn snow cut it off something  body 
4047,gameofthrones,rcharactercrossovers
4048,gameofthrones,this painting is algebraic  
4049,gameofthrones,so what is this one all about  i guess it s reference to the targaryon sigil is there supposed to be three people to rule westoros 
4050,gameofthrones,the hand on the ground is a nice touch 
4051,gameofthrones,if ever drogon has a baby dragon  he will be named rhaegon  and the world will tremble
4052,gameofthrones,tyrion traveled to castle black  the door is at the nightfort and sam only knows about it because of the ancient cold hands in the book and because he read am ancient book in the show  not to mention there is more common magic such as prophets  wargs  greenseers and the warlocks of qarth  everyone knows and admits that there was magic in the last  but the concensus is that it has faded from the world 
4053,gameofthrones,this is a reminder that theories still need to be tagged in this thread this post has an  all spoilers  title warning  but no  theory  warning spoilers from the books and show are fine without tags  but    major theory comments need green speculation spoiler tags       <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide   if you are unsure how to tag your comment  the  spoiler guide     <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide  has examples of the markup you can use   i am a bot  and this action was performed automatically please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   <URL>  to  rgameofthrones  if you have any questions or concerns 
4054,gameofthrones,i like to imagine that before mankind lived on westeros that a great part of the known world was dragons and white walkers a sort of yingyang relationship  counterbalancing each other  then as men moved onto westeros a disruption was caused now in the book things will even out as mankind will eventually be pushed off of the continent that s my ending 
4055,gameofthrones,no one knows about the black gate except sam  and brands group coldhands is the one who showed sam where it was  so the night s watch probably has no idea it s there  people believe that there is no magic anymore because the dragons died out  at that point in time  anything magical is a legend or story  except dragons  dragons were real  and not just stories from the east  but when the last one died people thought that magic had died with it  there are people who think that the return of magic is what enabled daenerys to hatch her dragons  or that her dragons hatching was a sign of magic returning 
4056,gameofthrones,this is something i never knew i needed until now 
4057,gameofthrones,what if the writers bran stark any mention of jon snow for at least the first episode  i feel like the writers are enjoying themselves at the watchers  pun not intended  expense  teaser 1     <URL>  v  ixi<SMILE>apisq<SMILE>i  shows jon snow possibly being taken by bran  jon is still alive the  second teaser     <URL>  v  omra<SMILE>nozf2q  shows already dead people  but then adds jon snow to the list  and first impression you start cursing but then you see people who are alive in the show i guess that is the whole idea behind teasers  the teasers do a great job bringing my interest back to game of thrones now back to the discussion back to the begging  what if they emit jon snow from the very first episode and continue the jon snow anger 
4058,gameofthrones,night s watch  dark brotherhood confirmed   o
4059,gameofthrones,this gate is at the night fortlong since abandoned and a fair distance from any of the 3 remaining active castles on the wall  sam discovers it because coldhands takes him there to seek out bran 
4060,gameofthrones,ghost looks either kinda sinister or kinda high with such big red eyes  but either way i m okay with it 
4061,gameofthrones, a few more     <URL>

4064,gameofthrones,i wonder how many damn times this has been posted 
4065,gameofthrones,is this a thing  this needs to be a thing 
4066,gameofthrones,am i the only one that loathes disney and thinks this  while being clever  shits on the spirit of the books and the show  i m watching someone get burned alive as i type
4067,gameofthrones,i was wondering if dany s other two dragons viserion and rhaegal hate her for locking them up back in season 4 in the episode  the wars to come  she went to see them  but they were nt really happy to see her and breathed fire at her and she left them again are they still loyal to her 
4068,gameofthrones,i think they re fucking pissed at her  but if they really hated her  she would nt have gotten out of that dungeon alive 
4069,gameofthrones,there s a prohpecy that says  the dragon must have three heads  people think that this means that azor ahai  the prophesied hero to save the world from the white walkers  will actually be three heroes  rather than one 
4070,gameofthrones,the night s watch does nt know about the black gate as it is kept hidden in a secret passage underneath a fort that has nt been used by them for centuries 
4071,gameofthrones, this     <URL>  is the highest voted thread on the main a song of ice and fire sub heavy theory spoilers  obviously 
4072,gameofthrones,personally i believe it is a prophecy about the true rulers of westeros stating that there must be 3 rulers  and each one would ride one of the dragons i believe that jon snow and dany are the first 2  assuming rl  j is correct but the third is up for debate in my opinion there are theories that it s tyrion  and that he is actually a targaryen it is also possible that jojens  sister  is actually jon snows twin sister and that she would be the third head or it could even be bran with the  you will never walk again  but you will fly  line  personally i d like it to be tyrion but that s just me 
4073,gameofthrones,there is a rumor that rhaegar s son aegon is still alive  apparently his body was switched during the sack of king s landing   could he be the third head if that was a truth 
4074,gameofthrones,the legend says that the dragon will have 3 heads and hints about the next targaryen emperor many people think it might be podrik because he might be a secret targ and always impress the women it is believed that this is because he is diphalic  meaning that he has 3 heads in total 
4075,gameofthrones,the last appearance of the white walkers was during the long night  about <SMILE>300 years prior to the start of the series  the valyrian freehold was nt founded until about 5000 years prior to the start of the series

4081,gameofthrones,i replaced targaryen 
4082,gameofthrones,these are great  if i had to pick my favorite is have a tough time i could never make anything like i do nt the targ one is as good as the others i think i m thrown of my different color dragon heads 
4083,gameofthrones,there is an episode in season 4 where it shows nights king turning a baby into what will be a white walker 
4084,gameofthrones,for number 4  that is exactly what was going on  craster gave them his babies  and in return the white walkers left him alone  craster s was said to be the only household in that area  so his sacrifices protected him 
4085,gameofthrones,you know what would be hilariously funny  in book 7 the white walkers are fighting at king s landing against the humans and all of a sudden this mass army of baby boys with blue eyes come out of nowhere and finish off the humans 
4086,gameofthrones,i mean what if they just wanted to build up more hype with it  or does anyone think that it truly means something that we do nt know about 
4087,gameofthrones,i found it irrelevant and not a teaser at all 
4088,gameofthrones,agreed  it did nt even tease anything hell  that tweet they sent annoucing it did a better job than the actual thing 
4089,gameofthrones, another golden rose  how original i eat from plates stamped with roses  i sleep in sheets embroidered with roses  i have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot as if that makes it smell any better roses are boring  dear

4091,gameofthrones,i have this colouring book the illustrations are beautiful well done on this one 
4092,gameofthrones,heels and lipstick 
4093,gameofthrones,looks like you got  teased 
4094,gameofthrones,jon snows face amongst the faces of those living and dead  with him talking about the dead rising seems pretty obvious to me
4095,gameofthrones,this is awesome    are you going to be selling any 
4096,gameofthrones,bingo we have a winner the only thing i got out of it is that jon is shown in between the dead characters and the living ones so take that for what its worth otherwise its just a cool commercial hype reel 
4097,gameofthrones,would have been a million times more exciting if the living characters were nt shown  and jon opened his eyes at the end of the teaser 
4098,gameofthrones,i think everyone will be upsetsurprised when this season focuses on bran and him having flashbacks to events that have happened leading up to the point we are at now all of this so the book can come out before the show moves forward with its release 
4099,gameofthrones,awesome work much more unique than the ones i ve made   <URL> all i did was follow a couple shitty tutorials 
4100,gameofthrones,that trailer knows nothing 
4101,gameofthrones,that s pretty obvious it s saying basically   is jon coming back  tune in to find out btw  valar morghulis 
4102,gameofthrones,valar morghulis 
4103,gameofthrones,one of the interesting things of the teaser is the thought that one or more characters as we know them were always deadnot  real  in the story as we know it and were always servants of the many faced god maybe they played that role across their entire characters history 
4104,gameofthrones,daenerys daenerys

4108,gameofthrones,at minimal  the high sparrow s followers are angry at the alleged incestuous relationship that produced joffrey amp  tommen any evidence that suggests the general populations  dismay with intertargaryen offspring during their rule

4118,gameofthrones,the way i see it is this  why would tyrion say something like that if it is nt for him to be proven wrong in due time  given the really specific subject matter of greyscale  and jorah s fate alongside tyrion s  it seems too convenient for this to be insignificant  i am starting to think that what will happen is jorah s character in the show will absorb victarion s from the book  as well as jon connington s   and the red priestess in the clip will eventually use magic to heal jorah s greyscale and give him a magic arm of some kind  mirroring victarion s arm in the books which is infected and spreading

4121,gameofthrones,these are fantastic i need that night s king 
4122,gameofthrones,possibly this sunday i doubt they would wait till march
4123,gameofthrones,i get the sense that hbo does nt care about keeping this  secret  anymore just last month  natalie was interviewed by kimmel and said that the poster of him had  already given it away  
4124,gameofthrones,i m going insane i recall there was a scene with tyrion where he s speaking to somebody who was plotting revenge  or something   each time the person would say what their plan was  he would follow with  and then what    his point was that the person was nt critically thinking through the consequences of their actions sufficiently  this is driving me nuts  because i do nt want to watch the last five seasons to find this scene  which  to the diehard  means i m lazy  but i prefer to call this  an attempt at efficiency     can anybody point me to what seasonepisode this happened in 
4125,gameofthrones,no idea  but the first thing that comes to mind is in s2e1  cersei  arya  she disappeared  tyrion  what  in a puff of smoke 
4126,gameofthrones,littlefinger  robb  walder  jon 
4127,gameofthrones,typical nice people  starks   do nt expect bad things to happen to them  they are the most vulnerable  naive even

4130,gameofthrones,the scene with jorah in season 5 episode 6  jorah describes how they are going to conquer westeros  then tyrion skeptically asks  then what  
4131,gameofthrones,well robb could haveif he married the right person 
4132,gameofthrones,wat
4133,gameofthrones,wake up starks    i hope arya can   see   the danger near her 
4134,gameofthrones,ned thought he can trust littlefinger  robb thought he can make friends with boltons and walder frey  jon snow saw betrayal among the night s watch before still did nt consider it happening to him  wth

4136,gameofthrones,i suppose it s possible some of these people will certainly be dead by the end of the story  but i think this teaser is meant to be more of a visual representation of valar morghulis 
4137,gameofthrones,he ordered to murder all robert s bastards  so he could know more than it looks
4138,gameofthrones,joffrey is the one who gave the dagger to the assassin to have bran killed in his sleep joffrey has known about his bastardom for a while 
4139,gameofthrones,i posted this theory in the teaser thread  but i wanted to hear everyone s thoughts on it excuse me for my shit writing  i ve been a firm believer that we will all or a strong majority of the characters die by the end of the story  per the ragnarok theory     i feel that the newly released teaser is a future vision by bran   i do nt think that all of these characters will necessarily die in the next season or book  but i think they will die before the conclusion of the story here is my reasoning  1 bran can have visions of the past  present  and future 2 the weirwood network is a catalyst for visions  and the left door to the the house of black and white just happens to be weirwood 3 looking at past season s teasers  i noticed that the show runners use clips of literal things that have occurred  are occurring  or will occur  they do not use the figurative storytelling some are suggesting this teaser to be 
4140,gameofthrones,i agree with you and i have always suspected he was the one who hired the dagger to kill bran 
4141,gameofthrones,i think he would rather acknowledge his lannister blood than his beratheon blood he did nt care for his father or his uncles so he naturally did nt see himself as one of them 
4142,gameofthrones,my personal view is that he is aware that he is a bastard it s pretty much thought throughout the seven kingdoms that he is but people fear saying it for obvious reasons it s the rumor everyone suspects but can not support because you will end up being killed like ned stark and there is really only circumstantial evidence  joffrey clings to his lannister heritage because his father never really loved him his mother always doted on him in addition he is at war with his  uncle  who is a baratheon he only uses the baratheon title as it suits his legacy he only invokes robert when trying to verbally hurt tywin his  legitimacy  is a relationship of convenience so he can maintain power he knows deep down what he is even if he ca nt or would nt prove it  i ca nt recall exactly but is nt there a scene where joffrey mentions  rumors  about his mother and  uncle  jaime also myrcella admits she s always known jaime is her father i know it s a different character but it does nt take much to make the leap tommen  i believe  is just naive and oblivious 
4143,gameofthrones,his name is joffrey  not joffery    hollywood can not live up to the power of imagination
4144,gameofthrones,his whole situation confuses me a bit  but i do nt think he knew about his true lineage  or chose to ignore it i forget which book it comes up in but  book spoilers    b  it is implied that he was behind the plot to try and assassinate bran because he overheard his father  robert said something along the lines of killing horses when they break a leg but lack ability to offer the same mercy to crippled children so he hired the assassin to try to get his fathers  approval why would he want roberts approval when he is always flaunting lannister colors and acting like a lion i guess cersei really messed up his mind   also  if he knew his true parentage he would actually be a bastard because his parents were nt married when he was born so it would be joffrey waters  pretty sure he was born in kings landing  
4145,gameofthrones,why is it presumed only the faces of the dead are kept there  before she went blind arya saw her own face on another person  as for the significance of  the dead come with it   pointing to the those who are still alive and presumed dead come simply imply that those characters will have an impact on the long nightwhich the inevitable winterdespite their mortality many of the characters  actions echo throughout the realm even after they have died  many other characters have died as well  but the ones shown that have died have had arguably the greatest shifts in the direction of events due to their impact while alive and the shifts that occurred due to their absence  and those still alive are the ones still left to leave their mark and should they fall will have the greatest impact from their absence 
4146,gameofthrones,thats a lot of typing to say very little the idea that jon snow s statement is used to introduce those that will fight the dead is very wishful thinking it s nice to hold on to hope watching this series unfold  but let s be reasonable with it if this trailer is saying anything at all  it is definitely not hopeful i still think there is a slight chance for a happy ending  but i do nt think this teaser is the place to find that i also believe that there is a much greater chance for this series to end in a very tragic manner 
4147,gameofthrones,the faceless men use faces from the people who die in the house of black and white 
4148,gameofthrones,gt  that is to say  we begin to hear him say  the long night is coming   while looking at jon s face  but only when the camera pans to the living characters does he finish with  and the dead come with it  double meaning of the phrase it s not just that the dead are rising to fight the living  but also that when the long night comes  many who live will die at its hands

4150,gameofthrones,sheeples overthinking things too much  it s just a trailer 
4151,gameofthrones,for some reason i thought that was davos next to joff 
4152,gameofthrones,frankly  i m tired of being teased  and this teaser in particular  told us even less than the ones posted to twitter a few weeks back i doubt any of the faces have any significance other than to summarize the big moments throughout the series ned stark s face was there  and we know for a fact  it rotted off his skull atop a spike in king s landing there s no way the faceless men have a copy they need the body to produce one it s why they wash all the sacrifices and drag them off to that chamber 
4153,gameofthrones,they have to get back to the island 
4154,gameofthrones,it s common knowledge by this point that jon snow will be coming backthough whether it s as his reborn self or something else  is unknown  personally  i think you re just overanalyzing a rather mediocre teaser trailer that told us absolutely nothing the main thing i m with you on is that the major theme was the living vs the dead as the starks amp  redemption are going to be a big part of s6  this teaser is likely to remind us of the dead charactersto weave in that plot of redemption and remind us that there will be some kind of retribution for the lannisters amp  boltons 
4155,gameofthrones,i m pretty sure the face next to joffrey s is davos 
4156,gameofthrones,ultimately i d say that there is no big secret meaning in this trailer remember all men must die so eventually the fm will have these faces regardless of our story i guess if you want to call it foreshadowing or something you can  but i would nt and i d say that all of the people in shot 6 will be dead by the end of book seven  rickon and bran are omitted 1 to carry the stark name  1 to be a tree 
4157,gameofthrones,here s how i see the teaser  ned starts with explaining how executions should be passed so we have   1    death by execution  robb goes on to explain how he s won every battle but lost the war so   2    death by war and what that means for everyone  catelyn then speaks about revenge and wanting to show other people what it s like to lose the things they love most so we have   3    death by revenge  why it is important to someone  then we have joffrey saying how he likes to torment and kill for fun because he s the king  the person who should care for his people   so we have   4    death by psychopaths who love it  finally we have jon  probably one of the only people in westeros who knows what s really coming so we have   5    death by an army of undead ice zombies that can wipe out all of westeros  as we see by the faces of tyrion  dany  sansa  jaime  cersei   basically  jon s statement acts as a nullification to the previous 4 statements they do nt matter because once the army of the dead marches  all those silly reasons like executions  wars  revenge and torment wo nt mean shit 
4158,gameofthrones,with today s release of a new teaser for season 6  i thought it might be interesting to take a deeper look into what is actually shown perhaps we could identify a pattern or some other clue to the significance of what we re seeing  ______________________________________________________________________________   shot 1     <URL> character  ned stark state  dead phrase   the man

starklannisterbolton  tyrion lannister  daenerys targaryen  cersei lannister  arya stark  jaime lannister state  all alive phrase  none themes  none ______________________________________________________________________________   identifying key elements    the most noticeable thing in this trailer is that it takes place in the house of black amp  white this is where the faceless men keep their  well  faces presumably only the faces of the dead are kept in this hall  and we do nt know how the faces make their way there it would nt be unreasonable to assume some kind of magic is involved  though this has yet to be confirmed or denied  i think the order in which the faces are shown is fairly significant for a number of reasons let s break it down   stark  stark  tullystark  lannister  lannisterbaratheon  baratheon  snowstark  wildling  starklannisterbolton  lannister  targaryen  lannister  stark  lannister it s easy to see that we have two major players  the starks and the lannisters when the teaser starts out there is a noticeable focus on the stark side as it progresses  things get a little bit muddled up and we start to see more lannisters  with some others interspersed it might be worth noting that sansa is also in some respect a lannister through marriage to tyrion  but then again it was never consummated and she was remarried to ramsay bolton this leads me to question if there are meant to be other connection through daenerys and arya i personally could nt see where arya comes in  but there is the potential for a link between tyrion and daenerys given the theory that tyrion is a secret targaryen it is possible  though unlikely  that this is a link the teaser is trying to hintat  moving forward  one of the most obvious distinctions in the teaser is the dead versus the living the first four shots all show characters that we re pretty much certain are all dead  except for one we then hit jon  who s fate has been debated since the end of the latest book following this  all characters that are currently alive i think it s pretty clear why it was linedup like this  they want to stir the debate about jon s life is he to be lumpedin with the dead before him  or the living after him  or is he some sort of fulcrum between the two  personally  i think that s exactly it currently he is dead  which should nt surprise anyone  but i and many others are convinced that he will return in some capacity that would make him both dead and alive during the season however  this careful placement could also be a red herring  and here s one of the biggest reasons why i think that might be the case  all of the dead characters say something in the teaser they each have a line that s been cut out from one of their scenes before death these  phrases  generally encapsulate the biggest aspects of that character ned s story was one of honor  robb s one of war  catelyn s one about family  joffrey s about control  and jon s about defending the realm the clips were carefully picked as the ones that best represented those characters before they died  and that includes jon so that could be a sort of nail in the coffin for jon  but the particularly insistent like myself might say that they re playing on the technicality that jon is currently dead  even if that may not continue to be the case it might also hint that jon snow is dead  and he will be somebody else when  if  he returns only time will tell for sure  the last obvious detail is that all these faces are in a place where only the dead should reside  so to speak given that we see six definitely living characters  we re clearly being led to wonder if there are implications being made here the faceless men are particularly fond the saying  valar morghulis  or  all men must die  this seems to be the obvious conclusion  all these characters will die  as will everyone else i ve also noticed that jon s line is the only one to span across two of the shots that is to say  we begin to hear him say  the long night is coming   while looking at jon s face  but only when the camera pans to the living characters does he finish with  and the dead come with it  the way this is done is very clearly deliberate  but to what end  talking about the dead just seems to cement the idea that these characters will die  right  but what if it s exactly the opposite  i think they re trying to emphasize that these characters will have significant roles in fighting the dead  and will be the major players that come out of it alive perhaps this is wishful thinking  but it would be terrible storytelling to just end with  and everybody died  i think we re looking at the six  maybe seven with jon   heroes  of the realm  if there s something i missed  please leave it in the comments  i m also interested to see everybody else s speculation on these things 
4159,gameofthrones,maybe jon coming back is just a faceless man 
4160,gameofthrones,people like maegary  sansa  littlefinger etc excels at politics and manipulation  but white walkers are pretty much a force of nature who do nt give a crap about anything other than obliteration of man  what we seen so far   there will be little politics involved except a treaty based on mutual destruction  and jon snow can provide that since he has delt similar things before so what use would be for these characters  other than act as civilians and sit the entire thing out  
4161,gameofthrones,sansa can walk around providing everyone with lemon cakes for when they re tired during the battle 
4162,gameofthrones,we do not know the motivation of the white walkers  there most likely will not be any sort of negotiation  tin foil over thinking it 
4163,gameofthrones,i would be extremely surprised and disappointed if all the wws are a  force of nature  and all they want is to kill everyone that would go against the narrativegrrms beliefsand it would just be boring 
4164,gameofthrones,guys  guys its all a dream conceived by bran im pretty sure he will wake up and then the real story will begin  or not  depends on how much of a jerk george is 
4165,gameofthrones,luckily grrm said he hates that kind of ending 
4166,gameofthrones,this is a reminder that theories still need to be tagged in this thread this post has an  all spoilers  title warning  but no  theory  warning spoilers from the books and show are fine without tags  but    major theory comments need green speculation spoiler tags       <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide   if you are unsure how to tag your comment  the  spoiler guide     <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide  has examples of the markup you can use   i am a bot  and this action was performed automatically please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   <URL>  to  rgameofthrones  if you have any questions or concerns 
4167,gameofthrones,nah  this would be bad writing
4168,gameofthrones,it s a dream and then saul wakes up and he is in albuquerque 
4169,gameofthrones,the whole story is happening inside an eye of a blue eyed giant 
4170,gameofthrones,in reality they would be of no use but i m sure they would talk their way into being kept around it s what they do they will convince others that they are needed and that s how they ll survive because it s the only way they know how
4171,gameofthrones,you re fooling yourself if you think it will be that straightforward even if they all work together  it will be an uneasy truce there will be plenty of internal conflict and everyone will have their eyes on the future who s in power when the dust settles 
4172,gameofthrones,so posted in another thread and this got my thinking what do you believe will be the last scene showed in the current tvshow   disregard possible prequels  sequels etc  personally i think it will be either varys  lf walking in the throne room  while some no good king  possibly daenrys gone all mad king  sit at the throne  and talking about the game plotting  the usual businsess varys will say something like  close but not enough  and lf will reply  oh this is merely the beginning of my climb  game of thrones you win or you die  or something along those lines  option b  sam writing down what really happened  after jon sacrificed himself to save the realm  putting the book at some shelf where nobody really ever look till next time winter is coming that is 
4173,gameofthrones,it s gon na be a bran scene  but i have no clue what it will be
4174,gameofthrones,sansa is a pretty good seamstress  and that s a skill that would be very useful on the battlefield to repair and make clothes plus  during the battle at the blackwater  she was pretty good at keeping calm and keeping the spirits of the noble women up  and in a long war  such positivity could be just as useful as any weapon or soldier maegary was great with the orphans  and could do something with that the fact is  yes  war requires soldiers and weapons  but it also requires people to cook and clean and make strategies and coordinate the troops  really  the least useful one could be littlefinger  who does nt know how to be  um  positive or deal with orphans or cook or clean 
4175,gameofthrones,oh god if it was i think i d kill myself 
4176,gameofthrones,i think that s a major underlining of the story all these people fighting and scrambling over the wrong fight  what use are they  no more use than nec stark they are there for the story  plus who knows what will come of the white walkers maybe the dragons will show up and kill them before they ever <URL> a serious issue for those below the wall 
4177,gameofthrones,the camera pans out to reveal a crumbling statue of liberty  revealing that it was earth all along 
4178,gameofthrones,i have nt read the books and only watched through the series once and i finished months ago so my details are shaky but it s like this  the faceless men who occupy that building can take the formidentity of those people remember the faceless man  jaqen hghar     <URL>   he was nt actually that person but killed that person and took his identity so faceless men  which arya is trying to <URL>  can use those identities on the wall  the last shot has all the main characters who are alive so far and that s just for effect as i understand  they ca nt actually use those identities in the story 
4179,gameofthrones,the faces are of people named by the many face god or ones that commit suicide in the house of black and white i assume people who worship the many faced god  pray for and tell their god of atrocities people commit  then the god somehow communicates with the faceless men and names someone if someone is not named  their face can not be used  remember what jaquen says to arya in the show about her killing someone not named   if you do nt remember  he tells her she stole a face from the many faced god stolen as if it can not be used
4180,gameofthrones,might as well catch some purple wedding too that might be his only  fuck yeah  reaction and of course  for the watch 
4181,gameofthrones,samwell tarly knows nothing 
4182,gameofthrones,sam knows it will most likely be the last time they see each other due to that it takes years for someone to <URL> a maester  the white walkers are coming soon  and the citadel is pretty far south from the wall  he knows nothing about the mutiny 
4183,gameofthrones,wellvalar morghulis 
4184,gameofthrones,all of the things the dead characters say are quotes they ve said before i want to say i heard jon snow say his quote at one point during the last season no one has noticed that all the faces are shown in order of when they died nedgt  robbgt  catelyngt  joffreygt  jon  it then shows the faces of all the living main characters maybe it s a coincidence but if you watch the red wedding  robb dies after his wife is stabbed to death catelyn soon looks over him as her own throat is slit  now whether jon is going to survive or not is up for speculation what could happen from interviews i have read  jon might not come into play truly towards the end of the season we may see him falling into the hands of someone who can infact revive him  or we may just see him being sent off on a farewell but here s what i think  jon is infact dead  but will be revived we have seen him wearing armor on set he s never worn before  and these would have to be later in the season  this is all up for grabs of course  jon snow could just be dead and as a fan or as fans we will just have to accept that but i think his story had more to it than what we ve been given and i can almost guarantee we will at least learn a great deal more about jon in the coming season  dead or alive 
4185,gameofthrones,hey there  sry for mi bed englis   after watching the teaser i am a bit bored  i forgot what exactly the faces on the wall meant  is every face displayed  or only people who did x or are going to die  are dead  i dont know anymore  what criteria does a face have to be on the wall 
4186,gameofthrones,33  walk of punishment   jaime gets his hand cut off  34  now his watch has ended   dany takes astapor like a badass  39  rains of castamere   obviously  42  lion and the rose   purple wedding  joffrey s death 46  the laws of gods and men   tyrion s speech 4<SMILE>  mountain and viper   another obvious one  410  the children   tyrion murders tywin 5<SMILE>  hardhome   jon kills white walker  59  the dance of dragons   shireen s burning 510  mother s mercy   jon snow s death
4187,gameofthrones,there s no way they would ve told sam and there s no way sam would ve left without warning jon if he had known 
4188,gameofthrones,how did the deserter  will  in season 1 get to winterfell   i should have   gone back to the wall   and warned them but i saw what i saw i saw the white walkers  if he passed through a manned castle  eastwatch  shadow tower  castle black   he would be questioned why he was alone  howwhy would he answer that without telling the brothers what had happened 
4189,gameofthrones,hey  i was rewatching the first episode yesterday as it aired in my country and i had this exact same question 
4190,gameofthrones,in s01e01  benjen and eddard are  discussing will and his desertion at the king s feast     <URL>  v  xrzav1ulyqq   benjen claims to know the guy eddard beheaded  which may support the fact that he saw will after he ran back to the wall  and knew he deserted when he was absent i doubt eddard would have shown benjen the severed head  but i could be wrong in that 
4191,gameofthrones,secret door at the night fort 
4192,gameofthrones,was he executed north of the wall  hmmmm  
4193,gameofthrones,i figured he snuck away while waiting in prison at castle black 
4194,gameofthrones,there s a whole chunk of land west of shadow tower with no wall and no castle he could ve just walked through the forest 
4195,gameofthrones,ok  so the husband and i have been rewatching season 5  and in episode 10   mother s mercy   we noticed a scene with samwell and jon snow where he is letting sam and gilly go to the citadel so that sam can train to <URL> a maester  we noticed that as sam and gilly leave  the look of stricken guilt on sam s face leaving castle black  at the end of this episode  jon snow  as  lord commander  of the nights watch meets an untimely demise from his brothers in black is there is a possible connection to this  does sam know before leaving what fate jon faces from his brothers  or would they have kept that from him knowing how close him and jon were  let me know what you think 
4196,gameofthrones,the wall does nt always tower over its surroundings it s higher in some places and lower in others he must have found a low point  which would make sense  because winterfell is pretty far west of castle black and he could ve run a long way looking for a place to cross  like  presumably  wildlings do all the time with their spoils from raiding 
4197,gameofthrones,i have been wondering this very thing for the past 2 years amp  i ve been too afraid to post it here asking in case i missed something i brought this up to my fiance many times amp  we ca nt seem to make sense of it 
4198,gameofthrones,i wondered this also i know there are some wildlings that raid the northern villagers osha got through somehow but  i do nt think it is said exactly how he got through 
4199,gameofthrones,probably through a castle that is not manned anymore 
4200,gameofthrones,i remeber reading somewhere that we went to the sea and took passage if i rmb if not he couldve just qent around or went to one of the many empty castles as a man of nw he wouldve known which were empty
4201,gameofthrones,ygritte s face looks more like yara greyjoy 
4202,gameofthrones,well she would have no reason to be next to jon  so

4211,gameofthrones,obviously  the rains of castamere  is the best valentines episode 
4212,gameofthrones, source     <URL> 
4213,gameofthrones, why is your hodor so big  
4214,gameofthrones,what is your name 
4215,gameofthrones,hodor 
4216,gameofthrones,where did  hodor  actually come from  is it inspired by a person  was is something walder  hodor s real name for those who do nt know  experienced  is there an explanation as to why he s somewhat dimwitted 
4217,gameofthrones,ask him if he remembers lt  alivegt   a world of warcraft  alliance  guild he used to be in several years ago when he played on a european server 
4218,gameofthrones,i m interviewing kristian nairn next week  thought it d be fun to get some suggestions from rgameofthrones 
4219,gameofthrones,i was doing some research for work  awesome that got sometimes overlaps with work  and i came across  this site     <URL>   they run game of thrones tours in northern ireland anyway  here s the important line  s6    s  cross carrickarede rope bridge  where a lord of the iron islands will meet his fate in season 6   so it looks like that s happening 
4220,gameofthrones,woah obviously balon right  sorry i m a casual   interesting they would just throw that out there  what s your job  if i may 
4221,gameofthrones,filming rumors also support the fact that balon will die on the bridge this season 
4222,gameofthrones,i ca nt believe they re shooting balon s death  murder   on the carrickarede bridge  every one in ireland knows the carrickarede bridge 
4223,gameofthrones,jon snow and ygritte died in the exact same place 
4224,gameofthrones,i hope jon has a moment where he talks to ned and ygritte before hes revived while theres no set rumors for ygritte being around  kit has been dating rose on and off for sometime  and they were spotted together recently holding hands  so most likely she stays close to the set because of kit 
4225,gameofthrones,it does look very likely 
4226,gameofthrones,god i was confused for so long i thought you meant at the same time as well as place and i was like wtf am i missing here like i know i m a casual watcher but how is that possible yeah that s pretty cool i ll choose to believe it s intentional
4227,gameofthrones,today i m introducing something that i ve been working on and off on for a while   an api of ice and fire     <URL>    what is it     an api of ice and fire     <URL>  is an  open source     <URL>  restish api for quantified and structured data from the universe of ice and fire  as well as the hboseries game of thrones   you can get access to structured data about most books  all characters and houses maybe you want to know which characters have pov chapters in the book a game of thrones or maybe you want to know which members are sworn to house targaryen  this api has all data that you would ever need  amp  nbsp    why    as i describe  here     <URL>   i love everything about the a song of ice and fire series and i frequently lurk in several subreddits i also wanted to give something back to the community with hopes that people will find this useful  amp  nbsp    how can i help    the great thing about this project is that it s open source and that everyone can contribute  you do nt need to be a programmer to help out  given below is a list with examples on how   you   can help with the project   grammatical errors in the data or on the website   error in the data  missing data  maybe that   awesome   character that you love is nt included in the data   implement or suggest new features  implement a language specific wrapper around the api  for example a   c    wrapper or a   python   wrapper would be awesome     anything else    i m open to   all   suggestions on how to improvide this project  now that you know how you can help  where do you submit your bugfixes  suggestions and other various fixes  since the project is open source and hosted at  github     <URL>  it s preferred to contribute there if you do nt have a github account you can help by posting over at the official  subreddit     <URL>   sending me a  tweet     <URL>  or sending an email to info  <URL> amp  nbsp    the future   hopefully this project will be appreciated by the community and other people will start using it in their projects and contribute to the api itself  amp  nbsp    questions    i would love to answer your questions if you have any

4229,gameofthrones,amazing work sir  really amazing following on gh 
4230,gameofthrones,well there are possibilities jon will certainly come back  this has been leaked and is without a doubt however  it might not be jon himself  it might just be a vessel to some other entity  bran could warg skinchange into jon and somehow keep him alive undead  yes  he  comes back  but it s not really jon snow  it s just bran in jon s body   i find this unlikely but the first teaser would be very suggestive towards this  the scene of jon dying coupled with the scene of bran warging into hodor  and would explain how jon would know of rl  j  if that is indeed true   if not bran  maybe bloodraven could warg or skinchange into jon  in the books he seems to be responsible for keeping coldhands undead   i still find it unlikely but it might be intereseting  given that bloodraven and the children of the forest might have agendas of their own  could be that some sort of entity representing the lord of light could possess him  if not the lord of light himself  given that he might be azor ahai and all that   i find this very unlikely and would not like it i prefer the idea that there are no gods and that magic is just another part of life  but these are all shots in the dark he s most likely being ressurected with magic  by melisandre and return as himself  just different 
4231,gameofthrones,the walk of shamedo you think it was the right punishment  i m thinking her hair will grow back and anything that walk broke in her is going to bounce back stronger i think years of banishment would have been more effective on her curious to see what others think 
4232,gameofthrones,it was probably a bad idea for those religious pussies she s going to get her revenge and i ca nt wait 
4233,gameofthrones,not sure where damp  d are going to go with her character but in the book  she starts all confident and this is nothing  attitude and by the end she is completely broken she realizes that she could only dream of being queen again now that everyone has seen her like that and her focus seems to have shifted entirely on protecting tommen but of course  it could be all acting from her part but yeah  as far as punishments go  it s in typical church fashion to diminish women like that  i doubt this  walk of atonement  is performed by men 
4234,gameofthrones,her walk of shame was just part of her punishment  she is still going to face a trial for her other crimes if she s found guilty  she ll be sentenced then  the walk was her punishment for the adultery she confessed to 
4235,gameofthrones,she only confessed adultery with lansol lannister since there was enough proof  denied all the others  twincest  betrayal  king robert s murder and many others   the high sparrow is not ned stupid  when she was acting in guilt during her confession he stopped her midway and asked if she wanted to make a confession when she asked for a little mercy to see her son  he let her go knowing full well she intends to get revenge  from what we saw from his conversation with lady orlena tyrrel  he threatened her with rebellion if she would to stop sending supplies   we are the many  you are the few   he s not intimidated at all by anyone  he s smart and calculating  and the best thing  he s actually fair and good he s one of my favorite characters in the show actually   i hope he livesreigns long 
4236,gameofthrones,has no one noticed the music used in the background before it reaches the wall with tyrionsaryas etc faces  it s the music in the hard home episode when the ww are massacring everyone the other side of the gate surely that s some implication that this trailer is aimed at the ww in some way  i m not really sure how to explain it but that must implicate something considering only one character here has fought the white walkers
4237,gameofthrones,  teaser  
4238,gameofthrones,this is a reminder that theories still need to be tagged in this thread this post has an  all spoilers  title warning  but no  theory  warning spoilers from the books and show are fine without tags  but    major theory comments need green speculation spoiler tags       <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide   if you are unsure how to tag your comment  the  spoiler guide     <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide  has examples of the markup you can use   i am a bot  and this action was performed automatically please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   <URL>  to  rgameofthrones  if you have any questions or concerns 
4239,gameofthrones,nice catch i need to rewatch the series so i can pick up on stuff like this better  probably some people noticed but thought it was kind of obvious why but i m glad you shared i think it s definitely supposed to tie in to how very soon  we re led to believe  the winter will be coming for everyone and they will all be affected
4240,gameofthrones,i noticed i think they only used it because it sounds cool 
4241,gameofthrones,the problem is for once a characters death doesnt fit the narrative jon snk has to live or else everything that made hk m special is a waste 
4242,gameofthrones,what is an api 
4243,gameofthrones,it is nt possible  it s downright a fact that all the characters in the story will die all men must die whose faces are in the teaser does nt matter no one is immortal even if some of those faces do nt die in our story  they will grow old and die sometime and the faces that are nt there will die too they just chose main characters for the teaser 
4244,gameofthrones,the likeliness of surviving after getting stabbed more than once in the torso is nt too big  without magical resurrecting powers 
4245,gameofthrones,any chance that this will be available on an app 
4246,gameofthrones,opening scene of next season is the nights watch people hiding his body  requires kit be there to film being carried around  explains why he s in his nw costume  and why hes all bloodied on the poster the ultimate got fuck you  to the fans  and we would fucking love them for it 
4247,gameofthrones,joffrey could nt be controlled in life when he was a teenage spoiled brat why would anyone want joffrey s unpredictability on a giant undead zombie that s nearly impossible to kill 
4248,gameofthrones,i hope she dies this season she s worst than joffrey in my opinion  damn lena headey is such a good actress   when she was put to the black cells  or whatever they re called  i was hoping she d die there or something the walk of shame was really just disappointing for me 
4249,gameofthrones,a big slice of humble pie will do one of two things to an ego we shall see which result we get 
4250,gameofthrones,ever frickin  wear hats  do nt they know that <SMILE>0  of body heat is lost through your head 
4251,gameofthrones,kit harington is obligated to show his gorgeous locks for the ladies  but qhorin  an experienced ranger  always wear hat and cover his ears he s also not handsome enough to be obligated to show his locks for the ladies all the time 
4252,gameofthrones,is it me or the thread titles are getting more and more buzzfeed style 
4253,gameofthrones,jon snow s knowledge is contagious 
4254,gameofthrones,you lose the same amount of body heat from all parts of your body <SMILE>0  does nt just float out of your head 
4255,gameofthrones,many viewers find it difficult enough to remember all the characters in the show if they wore identical plain black hats it would make it even more harder to remember the various actors 
4256,gameofthrones,lol funny you should mention this every time i find myself freezing during winter i think  but nights watch   seriously though some of those guys dont wear much
4257,gameofthrones,maybe the milliner  hat maker  for castle black was in apprenticeship training in old town as the old milliner passed away from old age 
4258,gameofthrones,this post has a  no spoilers  title warning  which means    all spoilers must be covered by warning tags       <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide   show tags are black book tags are red theory tags are green if you are unsure how to tag your comment  the  spoiler guide     <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide  has examples of the markup you can use   i am a bot  and this action was performed automatically please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   <URL>  to  rgameofthrones  if you have any questions or concerns 
4259,gameofthrones,first time i saw it i felt a bit sorry for her  but then i remembered everything she s done and i was like  yeah  f  ck this bitch  she deserved this 
4260,gameofthrones,makes sense to me they deserve it too  they ve been through hell 
4261,gameofthrones,the <SMILE>0  naturally occurring heat loss from the head  fact  is actually a myth  but in the case of the night s watch  chances are they are losing a lot of heat from not wearing hats frozen ears are the worst 
4262,gameofthrones,that was actually incredibly well done
4263,gameofthrones,if we are talking in the show not the book  i think it is because it is much easier to identify main characters when they are not wearing headgear it is quite common in movies for lead actors to eschew standard hats  hoods  helmets  gas masks  etc in situations where they would normally be warranted for sake of easier identification by the audience it is a conscious choice by directors  not usually an oversight 
4264,gameofthrones,there is more than one white walker come on people use common sense 
4265,gameofthrones,so im rewatching season 5  watching hardhome again  and i ca nt help but wonder what exactly are the zombie rules here  it is said that white walkers can only killed by dragon glass  and then we learn that valerian steel can too i believe both have to do with being forged by fire  i assume that valerian steel has some firerelated component that regular steel does nt   forgive my ignorance  but i assume that regular ol fire works too  given the fact that they burn bodies to prevent them from coming back  what about all those running skeletons  i noticed people aiming for headshots and it seemed that lopping off heads was stopping them but then when they were throwing themselves off the cliff  they picked themselves right back up and kept at it or did they go at it as long as their head was in tact  so what are the rules in killing them all  what determines who is a walker and who is a skeleton  also does reanimation only occur when it s winter on westeros  hence  when it s so cold in winterfell  the dead get reanimated  and the further south the cold goes the reanimation follows  also what about essos  no winter  no zombies 
4266,gameofthrones,there could be a certain amount of fuck it just slow them down  going into the headshots in the books  when mormont sends thorne south to king s landing with the dead wight s hand in a jar  he mentions this in the show too   the hand is still alive  and moving for most of thorne s journey by the time he gets to king s landing it s just a dead hand  but when he left castle black  it was solid proof that magic was back in play  anyway what that means  as far as the rules go  is that the brain is nt really in play it s likely some sort of rangebased magic  you never see big hordes of undead moving without white walkers nearby the only way to stop the wights is to stop the walkers 
4267,gameofthrones,white walkers  also known as others  are a different species  while wights are magically reanimated bodies  white walkers have been shown to be intelligent  have their own culture and history while the wights are like the walkers in the walking dead  there are stories of white walkers in asshai by the shadow  so maybe they re not confined to westeros  i do nt think normal fire can kill the white walkers  but it works on wights  valyrian steel is said to be set with magic spells  so maybe the magic component makes it able to kill the others  i do nt think the reasons why valyrian steel and obsidian are their weaknesses are described yet  the others are said to sleep during summer  and wake up during winter  some say they bring the winter with them  either way  they re connected to the cold  if the flesh holding together a wight s skeleton completely <URL>  the wight will die  individual limbs  though  continue moving when detached from the bodies if the flesh is intact  i usually think of them as normal zombies  slow and clumsy and can function even when injured  but the others control them 
4268,gameofthrones,it s likely that the first wights were cushioning the fall for the ones that fell on them  which would mean less damage for them the fact is  the white walkers have wights to spare  and they seem perfectly happy with sacrificing a few if it means they can get more  it seems that while headshots can work  you have to completely destroy the head  and even then  we ve seen that the limps can remain active  plus  you have to remember  these wights do seem to degrade  so the skeletons are just older  while the fresher wights are more human looking and it seems like for the resurrection to work  the white walkers must be close by we saw the night s king do it with very little effort 
4269,gameofthrones,if i am correct  white walkers  also called others  are alive  cursed sons of craster and probably other little kids that they could found in the north zombies and skeletons are called wights  are dead people that were reanimated by white walkers  i think that they can be reanimated as many times as white walkers want  as long as their bodies are not burned  altough if they are dismembered they are nt realy able to do much essos  no white walkers  no zombies
4270,gameofthrones,essos is further south than the north in westeros and as such there is no white walker activity there now  that we know of   however  during the long night  essos was attacked by white walkers also azor ahai fought them back in essos 
4271,gameofthrones,the hardest part vs white walkers is how to reduce casualties on yourside while inflecting casulaties on their side for white walkers every wright death is not a loss  only their commanders count your side  every person s death <URL> a number on white walker s army  if you happen to lose a few heros  say the hound   they retain their fighting style and now they are like robert strong this makes the battle very difficult 
4272,gameofthrones,dragon glass and valyrian steel are both produced using dragon fire it s not just any ol fire that will kill the walkers 
4273,gameofthrones,you know people resurrected by fire magic are also zombies call the ice zombies wights fire did nt seem to work against that other that jon fought  on the contrary  the only thing that can kill a wight is fire  others can make wights in the summer  since it is summer at the start of asoiaf techincally
4274,gameofthrones,how come the white walker that jon was fighting just disintegrated instantly when jon was killed it  and when sam shanked the white walker it didnt die instantly   pushes nerd glasses up 
4275,gameofthrones,white walkersothers are definitely vulnerable to valyrian steel and obsidian in hardhome their natural cold seemed to diminish the effects of nearby fire but i suspect that a lot of projectile fire would do the trick people burn the dead bodies to prevent them returning as wights  which are the zombie like creatures that are killed only by fire or severe dismemberment
4276,gameofthrones,not many rules understood it was discovered by sam that dragon glass kills ww  and dragon class is a result of volcanoes  another name for it obsidian jon was the only who discovered that valerian steel works too  it s knowledge is lost as well but everyone s got an itch that fire or dragons or volcanoes are involved  grrm says he relates valerian steel to damascus steel in real life and that it s knowledge was lost as well among other similarities  minus the magic offcourse  as for wights  aka your zombies  p they are stopped via chopping them into pieces or by fire the ww in hardhome that jon fought extinguished the fire before entering into the big tent  so i doubt fire works on them and i think it was mentioned in many sources it does nt work  except dragon s fire  that should work on both ww and wights as for the headshots  well  i guess they are just missing their headseyes so they are slowed as we saw in bran s battle with the wights  they do nt die or stop completely if you chop off their arms or heads  the two methods are burning or chopping them into many bits  slow them down enough they are nt a threat i guess 
4277,gameofthrones,it s tv  it s hbo  there are no rules
4278,gameofthrones,it s not got  but my sister did something similar with adventure time style art unfortunately  the only link i have to those particular pieces is on  this online store thing she setup     <URL>  show  new   but she did some horror movie characters in the style of adventure time and also did a darryl from the walking dead  hope it s okay i posted that link  i m not trying to necessarily promote her products  just thought people might enjoy the similar artwork even though it s not got 
4279,gameofthrones,i know this topic has been beat up on here  but i have nt seen a good discussion in a while i was looking at grrm s    1993 draft     <URL>    of the layout for what was originally supposed to be only three books  and i could nt help but notice that all his broad strokes are still on point  although some of the more specific storytelling may have strayed  the broad strokes still stand  amp  nbsp  he speaks of of three major conflicts that still hold till this day and seem to be central in asoiaf they are  1  starks vs lannisters 2  danny invading the seven kingdoms with a dorthraki army  grrm writes that this is the  second and greater threat  than the starks vs lannisters    3  the others  grrm writes that this is  the greatest danger of all   amp  nbsp  what is interesting is that these broad strokes for the three conflicts still stand central to the book and show  and they show us where he is going with the story my focus is on conflicts 2 and 3 conveniently  the end of season 5 has dany run into another dorthraki army fits in perfectly with what he wrote in 1993 about conflict 2  which would have dany invading the seven kingdoms fully loaded with dragons and a complete dorthraki army looking at conflict 3  we are told that grrm planned to  draw together the characters and plot threads  to prepare for the final battle with the others  which is another direction he has not strayed from  amp  nbsp  on top of these conflicts  grrm writes about the essentially confirmed theory of rl  j he notes   jon s true parentage is finally revealed in the last book  considering that in 1993 his plan was to write only three books and now we will have seven it is likely that jon s parentage will be revealed in either book 6 or 7  i find it more likely that it will be bookseason 6   amp  nbsp  the final point i wanted to make is that of the   f  ive central characters that will make it through all three volumes  they are  tyrion  dany  jon  arya  and bran all these central characters are alive and well  just as he planned in 1993 it is my belief that they will remain alive through the end because these characters  along with the three conflicts  were the foundation of his original draft  and as we are about 34s done with the story we have seen that these conflicts and characters have stood the test of time  amp  nbsp  some of you are probably sick and tired of this draft  but i find it very useful before i start getting attacked about how this or that did nt happen as was written in the draft  i want to point out that i am not focusing on the specifics he was writing about in this draft  i am talking more of the broad strokes he is speaking of i personally think that this draft should hold great weight when trying to theorize where this is going  amp  nbsp  i wanted to see what everyone thinks as to how much weight we should place into this draft considering all the broad strokes still stand furthermore  i wanted to see what else you think this draft reveals  and what are its implications on the endgame  amp  nbsp  thanks for hearing me out  amp  nbsp  edit  grammar and formatting
4280,gameofthrones,well with necromancer zombie rules  it seems likely it costs some magical effort to animate the dead  so a walker might abandon a zombie if it s too damaged to be immediately useful especially if there s a thousand others  one zombie  though  in a fight  it would make sense to keep running  even as it s being hacked to bits 
4281,gameofthrones,the white walkers have been trapped north for centuries so essos is most likely safe from them the white walkers were originally found in the north centuries ago and when they were beaten back out of westeros  they just ended up back in the north 
4282,gameofthrones,not a bookreader  though read all sorts of posts in these forums as well as dig into wikia etc  but very interested in asoiaf  really enjoyed reading the above thanks for posting  
4283,gameofthrones,fire only kills wights  ice zombies  and obsidian only kills the others  white walkers   i m not sure where valyrian steel fits in with wights  i m guessing it kills them 
4284,gameofthrones,the rule is  if you have plot armor  your weapons cause harm to those you point them at 
4285,gameofthrones,in the books maester aemon has studied dragons and believes that they are indeed hermaphrodites  though it seems there is no definite consensus on the issue 
4286,gameofthrones,valerian steel is only created with dragon fire it can be reforged without it but not created the name dragon glass  should also give it away it s not just ordinary obsidian this extra touch of magic is what kills the whites 
4287,gameofthrones,   <URL>     <URL> 
4288,gameofthrones,you do nt realise how unhealthily you care about these fictional characters until even the sight of their dead faces  metaphorical or otherwise  genuinely terrifies you 
4289,gameofthrones,donna noble has left the library donna noble has been saved 
4290,gameofthrones,a man appreciates a tease or two  but a man has a hunger for a trailer a showrunner would be merciful to release a trailer  and soon a man does not want to die of starvation all men must die  but first they must eat 
4291,gameofthrones,my heart would have jumped right out if they made jon s eyes snap open at the end 
4292,gameofthrones,omg they re going to kill every single character
4293,gameofthrones,where the hell was olly s face   he needs to die too 
4294,gameofthrones,i ve been a firm believer in the idea that got follows the story of ragnarok  and this seems to fit right in i feel that this is a future vision by bran i do nt think that all of these characters will die this <URL> season  but i think the ending of this story will be very tragic in the way of ragnarok  and yes we will see these characters die by the end of the story here is my reasoning  1 bran can have visions of the past  present  and future 2 the weirwood network is a catalyst for visions  and the left door to the the house of black and white just happens to be weirwood 3 looking at past season s teasers  i noticed that the show runners use clips of things that actually happen in the future  they do not use the figurative storytelling some are suggesting 
4295,gameofthrones,you might want to read into the empire of the dawn and the bloodstone emperor the latter is likely the cause of the white walker appearance 
4296,gameofthrones,you ve got ta be fucking kidding me they waited until midfebruary for this    edit  this is far and away the most popular thing i ve ever posted on reddit that s kinda depressing 
4297,gameofthrones,when jon gets done with olly there wo nt be anything left to put on the wall  his face will be an unrecognizable  bloody pulp   kill the boy     <URL> 
4298,gameofthrones,i could have swore ned looked like walter white
4299,gameofthrones,i like how they put jon s face right in between the faces of the knowndead and the knownalive characters they are so messing with us 
4300,gameofthrones,oh damn  a rsker got the first post  reap the karma my irish friend  also  of course it s bravosrelated but it s a good teaser 
4301,gameofthrones,you know  if the hall has all of those faces  would nt it be awkward if all the main characters are faceless men  fuckin  synths  man 
4302,gameofthrones,i swear that if the hound does nt make a return in season 6 then i m going to have to eat every fucking chicken in this room 
4303,gameofthrones,did they really need a teaser for this teaser 
4304,gameofthrones,the trailer sends its regards 
4305,gameofthrones,do nt take tyrion away from meus  
4306,gameofthrones,now all i am thinking is a normal sized faceless man putting tyrions face on and trying to convince everyone he is nt an imposter 
4307,gameofthrones,lol they covered  previously  on game of thrones  and  next time  on game of thrones  in one minute
4308,gameofthrones,so for those that could nt make it out  those 6 faces at the end were sansa  tyrion  dany and then the next row down was cersei  arya  jaime  you know who s face we did nt see  the hound   cleganebowlgethype
4309,gameofthrones,the drowned god has blessed him with a bouncing baby kraken

4322,gameofthrones,seriously why is everyone in power some kind of a tyrant or closeminded idiot  i know the world is set up as grimdark but it does nt make sense that almost every person in the courts seems to plot for themselves even though the peasants starve and are generally disregarded every person who seems good eventually dies due to their world here s some of the stuff in asoiaf that i think really is nt realistic and is just downright psychopathic   the people in king s landing resorting to cannibalism  some people attempting to rape sansa  joffrey sadistically killing whores w crossbow  sewing grey wind s head onto robb stark after he had been brutally murdered  cersei being an apathetic snob to everyone but for some reason backs down when against her children  sandor clegane in general  roose bolton doing roose bolton  fuck this guy   stannis sacrificing his own daughter  killing babies  burning children  clans of wildlings having human flesh for breakfast  lunch  and dinner  walder freycraster screwing his daughters people there need to chill the hell out   it s okay the rant is over    ps would nt mind some white walkers finding their way to king s landing  specifically the red keep

4327,gameofthrones,house starks words  winter is coming  after around my 4th rewatch i started to get a vibe around season 1 the things characters said about the starks and their words  the things sam says about jon later on  my theory  i guess you could call it is  winter is coming means in the end  the starks will win  in the end  the starks always come back  in the end  just like the seasons  no matter how long and hot the summers  no matter how bloody and beaten the family  winter and the starks always come back around i think the winds of winter is setting up to be a huge redemptionvengeance tale for the starks and their lineage winter is here just me trying to take a deeper look in the constant theme of their words prolly nothing  optimistic that its something though id love to hear any supporting excerpts and such down below discuss 
4328,gameofthrones,the lone wolf dies  but the pack survives
4329,gameofthrones,makes sense to me they deserve it too  they ve been through hell 
4330,gameofthrones,makes sense to me they deserve it too  they ve been through hell 
4331,gameofthrones,so posted in another thread and this got my thinking what do you believe will be the last scene showed in the current tvshow   disregard possible prequels  sequels etc  personally i think it will be either varys  lf walking in the throne room  while some no good king  possibly daenrys gone all mad king  sit at the throne  and talking about the game plotting  the usual businsess varys will say something like  close but not enough  and lf will reply  oh this is merely the beginning of my climb  game of thrones you win or you die  or something along those lines  option b  sam writing down what really happened  after jon sacrificed himself to save the realm  putting the book at some shelf where nobody really ever look till next time winter is coming that is 
4332,gameofthrones,the camera pans out to reveal a crumbling statue of liberty  revealing that it was earth all along 
4333,gameofthrones,it s gon na be a bran scene  but i have no clue what it will be
4334,gameofthrones,at minimal  the high sparrow s followers are angry at the alleged incestuous relationship that produced joffrey amp  tommen any evidence that suggests the general populations  dismay with intertargaryen offspring during their rule 
4335,gameofthrones,there was a major conflict in the early targaryen years called the faith militant uprising that had a few causes  including targaryens practicing incest and polygamy afterwards  the faith militant was disarmed and the targaryens gave up polygamy but not incest

4353,gameofthrones,i mean what if they just wanted to build up more hype with it  or does anyone think that it truly means something that we do nt know about 
4354,gameofthrones,looks like you got  teased 
4355,gameofthrones,i think it s simply  look  here are all these dead characters remember them  oh and here are some characters you love that can die too  possibly 
4356,gameofthrones,that s pretty obvious it s saying basically   is jon coming back  tune in to find out btw  valar morghulis 
4357,gameofthrones,valar morghulis 
4358,gameofthrones,jon snows face amongst the faces of those living and dead  with him talking about the dead rising seems pretty obvious to me
4359,gameofthrones,bingo we have a winner the only thing i got out of it is that jon is shown in between the dead characters and the living ones so take that for what its worth otherwise its just a cool commercial hype reel 
4360,gameofthrones,would have been a million times more exciting if the living characters were nt shown  and jon opened his eyes at the end of the teaser 
4361,gameofthrones,the north remembers
4362,gameofthrones,i found it irrelevant and not a teaser at all 
4363,gameofthrones,agreed  it did nt even tease anything hell  that tweet they sent annoucing it did a better job than the actual thing 
4364,gameofthrones,i think everyone will be upsetsurprised when this season focuses on bran and him having flashbacks to events that have happened leading up to the point we are at now all of this so the book can come out before the show moves forward with its release 
4365,gameofthrones,that trailer knows nothing 
4366,gameofthrones,one of the interesting things of the teaser is the thought that one or more characters as we know them were always deadnot  real  in the story as we know it and were always servants of the many faced god maybe they played that role across their entire characters history 
4367,gameofthrones,we ran a little contest last week to see who could come up with the best valentine s card  and here are the results   winner  uthecatizzle   image     <URL>    runnerup  uspinnerclotho   image 1     <URL>    image 2     <URL>  congratulations to both of you  and thanks to everyone who entered   click here if you want to see the original post     <URL>   which is scoped for tv spoilers   ps   this puppy     <URL>  is very proud of your achievements 
4368,gameofthrones,there s the scene when jon and we learn that craster s boy babies are being given to the white walkers  so it made me wonder  1 do the white walkers only want boy and not girl babies   yes  craster wants to keep his  wives   but wondering if there was something else to them being all boy babies  2 do the white walkers kill the babies who would then turn into white walkers  or do they keep them alive as humans for a time  3 are white walkers who were turned as babies different or magical in some way than ones who turned as adults  4 could ever the white walkers be pacified by being given babies   since they did nt seem to ever attack craster or his daughters 
4369,gameofthrones,there is an episode in season 4 where it shows nights king turning a baby into what will be a white walker 
4370,gameofthrones,for number 4  that is exactly what was going on  craster gave them his babies  and in return the white walkers left him alone  craster s was said to be the only household in that area  so his sacrifices protected him 
4371,gameofthrones,you know what would be hilariously funny  in book 7 the white walkers are fighting at king s landing against the humans and all of a sudden this mass army of baby boys with blue eyes come out of nowhere and finish off the humans 
4372,gameofthrones,guys  guys its all a dream conceived by bran im pretty sure he will wake up and then the real story will begin  or not  depends on how much of a jerk george is 
4373,gameofthrones,the whole story is happening inside an eye of a blue eyed giant

4379,gameofthrones,most of us were beyond disappointed that got did nt release any new footage during their  teaser   when do you guys expect a trailer to be released  a week  two  a month  idk

4389,gameofthrones,i know knights can <URL> landed and have land given to them by a lord  but can they outright <URL> a lord themselves with all the responsibilities that come with it 
4390,gameofthrones,this post has a  no spoilers  title warning  which means    all spoilers must be covered by warning tags       <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide   show tags are black book tags are red theory tags are green if you are unsure how to tag your comment  the  spoiler guide     <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide  has examples of the markup you can use   i am a bot  and this action was performed automatically please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   <URL>  to  rgameofthrones  if you have any questions or concerns 
4391,gameofthrones,i think that whether you re a lord or not is dependent on the land that your family owns if a knight or his family owns land to govern  then he s a lord just remember that just because the knight was born to a noble family  it does nt necessarily make the knight a lord 
4392,gameofthrones,i know this topic has been beat up on here  but i have nt seen a good discussion in a while i was looking at grrm s    1993 draft     <URL>    of the layout for what was originally supposed to be only three books  and i could nt help but notice that all his broad strokes are still on point  although some of the more specific storytelling may have strayed  the broad strokes still stand  amp  nbsp  he speaks of of three major conflicts that still hold till this day and seem to be central in asoiaf they are  1  starks vs lannisters 2  danny invading the seven kingdoms with a dorthraki army  grrm writes that this is the  second and greater threat  than the starks vs lannisters    3  the others  grrm writes that this is  the greatest danger of all   amp  nbsp  what is interesting is that these broad strokes for the three conflicts still stand central to the book and show  and they show us where he is going with the story my focus is on conflicts 2 and 3 conveniently  the end of season 5 has dany run into another dorthraki army fits in perfectly with what he wrote in 1993 about conflict 2  which would have dany invading the seven kingdoms fully loaded with dragons and a complete dorthraki army looking at conflict 3  we are told that grrm planned to  draw together the characters and plot threads  to prepare for the final battle with the others  which is another direction he has not strayed from  amp  nbsp  on top of these conflicts  grrm writes about the essentially confirmed theory of rl  j he notes   jon s true parentage is finally revealed in the last book  considering that in 1993 his plan was to write only three books and now we will have seven it is likely that jon s parentage will be revealed in either book 6 or 7  i find it more likely that it will be bookseason 6   amp  nbsp  the final point i wanted to make is that of the   f  ive central characters that will make it through all three volumes  they are  tyrion  dany  jon  arya  and bran all these central characters are alive and well  just as he planned in 1993 it is my belief that they will remain alive through the end because these characters  along with the three conflicts  were the foundation of his original draft  and as we are about 34s done with the story we have seen that these conflicts and characters have stood the test of time  amp  nbsp  some of you are probably sick and tired of this draft  but i find it very useful before i start getting attacked about how this or that did nt happen as was written in the draft  i want to point out that i am not focusing on the specifics he was writing about in this draft  i am talking more of the broad strokes he is speaking of i personally think that this draft should hold great weight when trying to theorize where this is going  amp  nbsp  i wanted to see what everyone thinks as to how much weight we should place into this draft considering all the broad strokes still stand furthermore  i wanted to see what else you think this draft reveals  and what are its implications on the endgame  amp  nbsp  thanks for hearing me out  amp  nbsp  edit  grammar and formatting
4393,gameofthrones,unfortunately it still does nt tell us very much because if we are going to have a discussion it has to be about the specifics  and as we know many of those have changed so 
4394,gameofthrones,not a bookreader  though read all sorts of posts in these forums as well as dig into wikia etc  but very interested in asoiaf  really enjoyed reading the above thanks for posting  
4395,gameofthrones,the only thing that imo remains the same is the major role that jon plays in asoiaf  the draft  the hints  does nt mean that the end will be good for him  i believe in jon and dany <URL> enemies 
4396,gameofthrones,ygritte s face looks more like yara greyjoy 
4397,gameofthrones,well she would have no reason to be next to jon  so

4401,gameofthrones,i adore the  unsullied theme     <URL>  v  kiyisuzc6e   or maybe i just love the scenes with this theme in it  either way i could mention a hundred others  stannis  theme  robert s theme  which you obviously never hear any more  but you miss it   that punkrock bear and the maiden fair  creepy arya theme  wildling battle themes  listen for them in the battle at castle black  fucking brilliant   faceless man s little chord  this show has a pretty good soundtrack  i guess  is the sparknotes 
4402,gameofthrones,my personal favorites   forgive me  season 5   oathkeeper  season 4   the night s watch  season 1 
4403,gameofthrones,i want a full good version of the bear and the maiden fair 
4404,gameofthrones,yeah it s nothing more than hype building i m cracking up at the people trying to read into the position of the faces 
4405,gameofthrones,i saw a long time ago a theory suggesting that ned stark hired a faceless man in season one to take his fall for him and he s has been pulling strings from far far away if anything the trailer made me think thatsslightly more possible okay okay shame me in the streets i know its crazy 
4406,gameofthrones,will aegon targaryen make a show appearance or has dany absorbed him at this point so to speak  seems like a missed opportunity because he would add a great dynamic to the show and to the claim to the throne 
4407,gameofthrones,i highly doubt he ll make the show there s so much of that storyline they ve already missed and ca nt really do anymore  and i think the show is going with dany to be the only one invading westeros they ve already given jon connington s greyscale to jorah 
4408,gameofthrones,with how varys regards dany i think it s safe to assume that she s taken his role 
4409,gameofthrones,aegon blackfyre 
4410,gameofthrones,thanks natalie for confirming what we already know 
4411,gameofthrones,lol they covered  previously  on game of thrones  and  next time  on game of thrones  in one minute
4412,gameofthrones,now all i am thinking is a normal sized faceless man putting tyrions face on and trying to convince everyone he is nt an imposter 
4413,gameofthrones,i like how they put jon s face right in between the faces of the knowndead and the knownalive characters they are so messing with us 
4414,gameofthrones,   <URL>     <URL> 
4415,gameofthrones,i swear that if the hound does nt make a return in season 6 then i m going to have to eat every fucking chicken in this room 
4416,gameofthrones,so for those that could nt make it out  those 6 faces at the end were sansa  tyrion  dany and then the next row down was cersei  arya  jaime  you know who s face we did nt see  the hound   cleganebowlgethype
4417,gameofthrones,did they really need a teaser for this teaser 
4418,gameofthrones,you do nt realise how unhealthily you care about these fictional characters until even the sight of their dead faces  metaphorical or otherwise  genuinely terrifies you 
4419,gameofthrones,you know  if the hall has all of those faces  would nt it be awkward if all the main characters are faceless men  fuckin  synths  man 
4420,gameofthrones,donna noble has left the library donna noble has been saved 
4421,gameofthrones,a man appreciates a tease or two  but a man has a hunger for a trailer a showrunner would be merciful to release a trailer  and soon a man does not want to die of starvation all men must die  but first they must eat 
4422,gameofthrones,i could have swore ned looked like walter white
4423,gameofthrones,when jon gets done with olly there wo nt be anything left to put on the wall  his face will be an unrecognizable  bloody pulp   kill the boy     <URL> 
4424,gameofthrones,my heart would have jumped right out if they made jon s eyes snap open at the end 
4425,gameofthrones,omg they re going to kill every single character
4426,gameofthrones,do nt take tyrion away from meus  
4427,gameofthrones,you ve got ta be fucking kidding me they waited until midfebruary for this    edit  this is far and away the most popular thing i ve ever posted on reddit that s kinda depressing 
4428,gameofthrones,where the hell was olly s face   he needs to die too 
4429,gameofthrones,the trailer sends its regards 
4430,gameofthrones,i ve been a firm believer in the idea that got follows the story of ragnarok  and this seems to fit right in i feel that this is a future vision by bran i do nt think that all of these characters will die this <URL> season  but i think the ending of this story will be very tragic in the way of ragnarok  and yes we will see these characters die by the end of the story here is my reasoning  1 bran can have visions of the past  present  and future 2 the weirwood network is a catalyst for visions  and the left door to the the house of black and white just happens to be weirwood 3 looking at past season s teasers  i noticed that the show runners use clips of things that actually happen in the future  they do not use the figurative storytelling some are suggesting 
4431,gameofthrones,oh damn  a rsker got the first post  reap the karma my irish friend  also  of course it s bravosrelated but it s a good teaser 
4432,gameofthrones,night s watch time  come on grab your crows 
4433,gameofthrones,just hype  all men must die  i think they saw that amazing arya fanart and were inspired but i dont think it tranalated well into a trailer because people are taking it seriously 
4434,gameofthrones,i have to say it s awesome to have an so that geeks out with me my wife made me a cake with daenarys on it  then gifted me with ten game of thrones pop vinyls and got us matching necklaces my sunmy moon

4436,gameofthrones,gt  and i could nt help but notice that all his broad strokes are still on point although some of the more specific storytelling may have strayed  the broad strokes still stand  meh any writer knows that once the rubber hits the proverbial road  things can change dramatically even if you keep the broad strokes  the individual specifics can change so much its entirely different situation 
4437,gameofthrones,this legit looks like frankjavcee
4438,gameofthrones,i think it would bring in the world from the show and books beautifully imagine having to escape from the white walker and wights army north of the wall the sense of fear would be incredibly potent  unless if you have dragon glass or valerian steal of course   all of westeros would of course be included up from the  haunted forest  to  dorn  and every island in between with everything replicating the map in it s entirety  the story line would also be well created and bendable hopefully even more so with skyrim with more options to save the characters you care for if you manage to save the day under extreme conditions and tasks  the game would likely start with you choosing an existing character or creating your own one and witnessing a important event such as the beheading of eddard stark or something more tranquil depending on the character you have chosen for example if you picked john snow you might start the game finding out out your uncle  benjen stark  has gone missing and your given a mission to try and find out what has happened if you pick sam you need to start out by trying to survive the training without getting beaten down too badly as you arrive to castle black of course not every character would have a specific start some would use the same sort of starter missions because of how many there are to choose from  some characters should not be playable at all such as arya stark as you would not be allowed to die as you are only a child however other important characters such as sandor and brienne should be playable  important events could happen within the story such as different armies rallying up and you have the choice to choose a side or go against both of them and maybe even creating your own army if you <URL> wealthy and powerful enough  i could imagine myself picking a character such as john snow or petyr baelish  haha  and riding one of khaleesi s dragons taking out white walkers when they eventually breach the wall in late game  they would be a great deal of speech in the game especially for talkative characters which allow you to betray and manipulate people like in the show but you can use it for the greater good or for evil  what do you all think 
4439,gameofthrones,everything in my body and mind says yes so obviously  bethesda will say no 
4440,gameofthrones,i think it would work better using telltale s method of adoption a new house or smaller house for the story  but more rpg style obviously then your new character could follow along the events but from a different perspective  seeing as we already know the perspectives of our favourite characters  makes me sad that it s never gon na happen though   
4441,gameofthrones,the wars to come warrior of light forgive me  season 5  any of the blackwater soundtracks what is dead may never die winterfell goodbye brother finale two swords
4442,gameofthrones,they ve volunteered or have been pressured to join the night s watch  for many  in lieu of imprisonment or execution  or are you asking about the other brotherhood from the third season 
4443,gameofthrones,the kingsroad  the song that plays when jon and ned have one last conversation before they split off to the wall and king s landing  i also loved  this     youtubegwmgrr9a<SMILE>1<SMILE>  t  7m9s  version however  it s not in the official soundtrack full track  here     <URL>  v  rmhbradndhc   the wars to come  when stannis got owned by the boltons loved the music that went with the charge 
4444,gameofthrones,i guess we had to get the teaser out of the way before we get a true trailer 
4445,gameofthrones,neither sandor or gregor were there so they are nt dead  cleganebowl 2016 hype        s

4447,gameofthrones,so basically this whole teaser is just saying all men must die i do nt think anything is to be taken literally with this teaser at all 
4448,gameofthrones,the character is lady stoneheart  now  let me start by saying that i do not find this likely game of thrones has seemed to find its own groove and does not seem to need lady stoneheart in the mix however  it s not inconceivable  in the new teaser  i found catelyn s  quote     youtubeomra<SMILE>nozf2q  t  39s  to be particularly interesting it s  her line from s03e09     youtubessiej1rkjpm  t  1m43s  and it is a particularly vindictive one   show them how it feels to lose what they love  i find it interesting because it definitely reflects lady stoneheart s revenge obssessed character and i was wondering if this could be a clue from damp  d     do you think we ll ever get to see lady stoneheart in the show 
4449,gameofthrones,riverrun  aka lsh country  will be a major focus this season  brienne will be there and is confirmed to meet with jamie there under unfortunate circumstances  the freys are confirmed to return this season  and certain characters that lsh personally kills are casted and set to appear  theres rumors that the bwb are showing up this season  one of the special effect guys said there was a plot that was cut from season 4 and 5 that is finally happening in season 6  combine all that  with a possible hint directly from hbo in the teaser  its very very possible we will get lsh  we do nt have much in casting rumors regarding michelle fairley being on set  but keep in mind  the bwb was filmed in doors  and this is something that could easily have been concealed also keep in mind  michelle fairley does nt live that far from the filming 
4450,gameofthrones,i do nt think there s really a chance i think it would probably lessen the magnitude and significance of jon s resurrection 
4451,gameofthrones,one thing s for sure  it s now or never all of the pieces seem to be in place personally  i d love to see it happen  but i m leaning on the less likely side 
4452,gameofthrones,as people hated that s5 was too much different from books  i think that if damp  d can learn from their mistakes  they will try to return it to be closer to books in s6 as there will be riverrun plotline  there could as well add lsh in  just as in the books  i personaly have feeling that all those dead characters  that had lines in teaser will have big inpact this season   theorytinfoil    g  ned will probably be in important flashbacks  catgt  lsh  rob it could be something from that time when he wanted to make jon legal stark  joffrey it will be either that cersei will start acting as joffrey or that he is head of robert strong  jon nuff said  
4453,gameofthrones,100  confirmed lsh appears in season 6  i ca nt say anymore 
4454,gameofthrones,no  lsh wo nt be in the show 
4455,gameofthrones,this is a reminder that theories still need to be tagged in this thread this post has an  all spoilers  title warning  but no  theory  warning spoilers from the books and show are fine without tags  but    major theory comments need green speculation spoiler tags       <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide   if you are unsure how to tag your comment  the  spoiler guide     <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide  has examples of the markup you can use   i am a bot  and this action was performed automatically please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   <URL>  to  rgameofthrones  if you have any questions or concerns 
4456,gameofthrones,in the show  it seems to just be a song she made up the lyrics are taken from quotes from stannis s court jester patchface in the books 
4457,gameofthrones, it s always summer under the sea     <URL>  v  ubghsjbh7gw   it was apparently made up by princess shireen baratheon 
4458,gameofthrones,honestly  i do not think the formula that bethesda developed during their last few games would lend itself very well to the asoiaf universe there are three main points in skyrim and fallout 4 that imo would make for a very bad translation into westeros 1 the player always has total freedom to do whatever he wants  no part of the world advances without player input  you can always drop whatever you were doing and go to a totally different place and nobody will mind at all  2 the player is everywhere recognized as  the hero  and every faction you join gives you an important position at the very beginning  3 very little dialogue  that especially in fallout 4 was more or less just an excuse for an  accept mission  screen  i understand that some people might like the notion of playing as peter baelish  who is married to daenerys  can summon dragons  is eddard stark s best friend  lord commander of the night s watch  prince of dorne  leader of the faceless men and hand of the king   all at the same time   or join the night s watch as a nameless recruit  say your vows  then just walk away to the south in order to save eddard stark from execution  next go to tywin lannister in casterly rock  kill a few bandits for him and be named general of his armies  i can see the appeal in such a total sandbox game for some people  but that would be a waste of a universe that heavily builds on its existing story  and if the player is in addition to that also able to influence the <URL> of all important events  it would either be extremely expensive to create  write and record a script for the red wedding if any of the characters present might be dead or be in another place  if other characters might be present depending on what the player had done  if the player himself would interfer  how the world would react if the player killed everyone present  if the player had already destroyed the world with dragonfire prior to doing that quest   or  in order to save those costs  the illusion of freedom would only be a lie  eg robb stark would always be present at the red wedding  no matter what the player might do to stop him from going   or if the player performed actions that would change history  it would just correct itself  you can save commander mormont from being betrayed  but he will just be killed by a white walker moments later so jon can <URL> lord commander   at which point  why even do it then  a sandbox game with nameless characters during another time period of anarchy where the paths of the main players are not as clearly defined  like the blackfyre rebellion  might work  but if it is set during the events of the bookshow  i can not see how it would be anything more than tons and tons of fanfiction  with very little of what actually makes asoiaf what it is 
4459,gameofthrones,in this video  a red priestess mentions stone men   youtubeztfb3eujcva  t  2m32s tyrion then says  good luck stopping the spread of greyscale with prayer  could this be a possible foreshadowing  what if a red priestess cures jorahs greyscale 
4460,gameofthrones,  <URL>  p  tshirtamp  style  mens just wanted to see what you guys thought of this shirt design i did for a graphic design class  feedback is appreciated 
4461,gameofthrones,jon snow said the long night is coming he s definitely gon na resurrect and <URL> azor ahai 
4462,gameofthrones,its runny how they did nt show ramsey  which obviously means he s the sole survivor i can imagine the very last scene being him riding drogon while waving a sausage 
4463,gameofthrones,why is gendry and the other group of people traveling to the wall associated with the brotherhood 
4464,gameofthrones,it would be cool if you started as a thief being transported to the nights watch during the war of five kings and then some crazy shit happens to your caravan and you escape kinda like the start of skyrim  then you could pick a faction that would determine the rest of your story  nights watch  brotherhood  rob starks rebels  iron islanders  lanisters  ect 
4465,gameofthrones,i just do nt see it happening with the ways actors and actresses are followed nowadays  someone would have let the community know that the actress who plays lsh was present when shooting

4470,gameofthrones,i was just re watching the show and a reached the point in season 2 where dany says that her dragons will be the only children she will ever have does this mean that she does not want another child  or does it mean that she can not bear another child  did the incident with the pyre make her infertile 
4471,gameofthrones,in the books she <URL> barren cause of a curse in book 1 but at the end of book 5 she regains the ability to have children somehow 
4472,gameofthrones,didn  t she get her period again in book 5  am i mistaken

4478,gameofthrones,i do nt think so the whole theme of the trailers has been basically  the past is already written  so  i think that the characters we saw in the hall of faces are going to be in flashbacks through bran  perhaps played by other younger actors  and that the main plotlines will be impacted by characters gaining knowledge and insight from past events  edit  clarity
4479,gameofthrones,i personally think it would be awesome if lsh amp  jon both came back if anything just to finally make peace with one another since catelyn stark never truly accepted jon as a stark at least not in the tv version  have nt read the books

4483,gameofthrones,this is probably a stupid question but was the long light dark all the time  like actuall night  i read the wiki on the long night but it does not reference whether it was an literal dark time  or the days and light were just blistering cold 
4484,gameofthrones,i ve never really thought about it  at first  i figured it described something like how the days <URL> shorter during our winters  but it might have also been darkness throughout the day  gt  fear is for the long night  when the sun hides its face for years at a time  and little children are are born and live and die in total darkness  gt  thousands and thousands of years ago  a winter fell so cold and hard and endless beyond all memory of man there came a night that lasted a generation  and kings shivered and died in their castles even as the swineherds in their hovels  old nan  a game of thrones  but the world of ice and fire says  gt  when a season of winter came that has lasted a generation  a generation in which children were born  grew into adulthood  and in many cases died without ever seeing the spring indeed some of the old wives  tales say that they never even beheld the light of day  so complete was the winter that fell on the world while this last may well be no more than fancy  the fact that some cataclysm took place many thousands of years seems certain  the long night  the world of ice and fire  there are also legends about the darkness in asshai  and in yi ti  and along the rhoyne  i m not sure if it s explicitly explained  because now i m just as confusedintrigued about it as you 
4485,gameofthrones, the long night   not the long light sorry  apparently i m an idiot lol
4486,gameofthrones,were the north men subject to darkness for 10 years  that s the question
4487,gameofthrones,the only ones i can think of off the top of my head are  oathkeeper  and  needle  i personally would want needle  because arya is my soul sister 
4488,gameofthrones,1 dark sister  visenya s sword  2 blackfyre  aegon targaryen s sword  3 dawn  tell ancestral sword of house dayne  4 brightroar  the lost valyrian sword of house lannister  5 widow s wail  jeffrey s  6 ice  the ancestral sword of house stark  7 lion s tooth  joffrey s sword that was thrown into the river  <SMILE> hearteater  joffrey s sword after lion s tooth  <SMILE> heartsbane  ancestral valyrian sword of house tarly  10 lady forlorn  lyn corbray s word  11 lamentation  house royce s ancestral sword  there are probably more  though 
4489,gameofthrones,i would like longclaw  it s plain  it s elegant  and it s the only one i remember being described as a bastard sword

4493,gameofthrones,wow  what is that in the middle  is it a stamp 
4494,gameofthrones,just wear ringmail under your dress clothes and swear loyalty to your host 
4495,gameofthrones,dawn and red rain  because they re different from every other valeryian sword
4496,gameofthrones,why would your sister ever make this her wedding invitation
4497,gameofthrones,well both of sansa s weddings went pretty well except for what came after the second one but the wedding itself was beautiful and no one died and tommen and margery s went off without a hitch perhaps got weddings have <URL> a little less treacherous 
4498,gameofthrones,i m looking for a video or series that recaps the major events of each season so i can put it on for my parents before they watch the next season i always find that by the time the next season comes out they ve forgotten loads of major plot points with a story so indepth as this it would be nice to have a video explaining everything that happened so i do nt have to explain what s going on all the time i d prefer a video that it just clips from the show and not just someone talking about what happened  if you ca nt find one  i d love to see one created ready for the new season 
4499,gameofthrones,here s every death   <URL>  v  0k725l92mk4
4500,gameofthrones,2 pieces of advice  firstly do nt lock your direwolf outside and secondly make sure you wear some chainmail under your suit
4501,gameofthrones,only one i d want is dawn because valyrian steel just is nt as cool as metal from  space   other than that i do nt particularly like swords  as decidedly noncanon as it may be  not sure   the acok module for mount amp  blade warband included a named valyrian steel halberd ca nt remember what it was called  but it instantly became my favourite weapon in the game 
4502,gameofthrones,since it is your sister s wedding  do you like the groom  otherwise should just hope for a purple wedding 
4503,gameofthrones,walk up to random people in the wedding and say  the  insert last name  send their regards  bonus if there s rains of castamere playing in the background 
4504,gameofthrones,i m not talking about who is appointed to rule  nothing that happened in e10 what happens  directly after  daenerys flies off  what do the sons of the harpy do  just walk away  i ca nt imagine they would be easily let go or easily decide to just leave 
4505,gameofthrones,considering none of that happened  or in that fashion it s damp  d s lack of imagination and story telling expect to see more of the same in s6 considering they no longer have official source material  they have a guideline grrm told them about  to copy from  it can be assume most of them fled  seeing a dragon is not a normal occurrence let alone one breathing fire and killing people 
4506,gameofthrones,the sons of harpy will obviously try to gain control of the other two dragons  if you do nt see this coming you are a moron  i d suspect that once they try to control the dragons several sons of harpy are fried adn they abandon that plan and the two dragons are free to fly and burn 
4507,gameofthrones,if i really believed in bad luck  i d probably think that this is a bad idea 
4508,gameofthrones,a toss up between  ice  before tywin melted it down and  oathkeeper 
4509,gameofthrones,i ve heard that a dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair 
4510,gameofthrones,i watched this a while ago  but that night s watch oath never gets old  pure epicness 
4511,gameofthrones,kind of creeped out at times with the sync to the voices reminds me of when you film something at 34 speed and play it back at normal 
4512,gameofthrones,nice  i had a very similar design for my wedding invitation  then had a seating plan with all the different houses from the show
4513,gameofthrones,the cringe is coming      s
4514,gameofthrones,yothat type placement is really bad cool thought  not so great execution 
4515,gameofthrones,this retrospect goes through the main stuff in chronological order seasons 15  starting from 0  2<SMILE>    <URL>  v  wfmqnvj9qvq
4516,gameofthrones,lol khaleesi s part is hilarious
4517,gameofthrones,what the fuck
4518,gameofthrones,this was a lot less terrible than i expected 
4519,gameofthrones,well their target did just fly away on a dragon 
4520,gameofthrones,please let there be a season 5 one with shame shame shame ding ding ding pleaaaaseeee
4521,gameofthrones,i m amazed at the effort ppl go to to make shit like this i really enjoyed it 
4522,gameofthrones,there s music over it but this is pretty good video it s going to be hard to find a good recap without someone talking over it    <URL>  v  4np10a_mr_k
4523,gameofthrones,very nice 
4524,gameofthrones,it makes me wonder  how many of dany s initial batch of freed slaves are still alive 
4525,gameofthrones,never fails to amaze me but this thing is like a year old there has been a season 2 version as well which i did nt like tbh
4526,gameofthrones,the lone wolf dies  but the pack survives
4527,gameofthrones,makes sense to me they deserve it too  they ve been through hell 
4528,gameofthrones,that was compelling stuff excellent 
4529,gameofthrones,i just assumed they all fled with shitcaked pants because they just saw a huge fire breathing dragon  and the queen mount the dragon little daggers do nt stop that 
4530,gameofthrones,house starks words  winter is coming  after around my 4th rewatch i started to get a vibe around season 1 the things characters said about the starks and their words  the things sam says about jon later on  my theory  i guess you could call it is  winter is coming means in the end  the starks will win  in the end  the starks always come back  in the end  just like the seasons  no matter how long and hot the summers  no matter how bloody and beaten the family  winter and the starks always come back around i think the winds of winter is setting up to be a huge redemptionvengeance tale for the starks and their lineage winter is here just me trying to take a deeper look in the constant theme of their words prolly nothing  optimistic that its something though id love to hear any supporting excerpts and such down below discuss 
4531,gameofthrones,i ca nt recall if arya knows that joffrey is dead is he still on her list  if not how did she hear that he died 
4532,gameofthrones,yea i think show arya only has like 4 names left cersei and ilan payne were two of the four if i m not mistaken and that might be in show not books been a while since i read

4534,gameofthrones, i am the dragon s daughter  gives me chills everytime
4535,gameofthrones, they one they did for season 2     <URL>  v  tr2qahux4na  is genuinely really good 
4536,gameofthrones,i was hoping for something funny  but this was just really gay
4537,gameofthrones,she heard it from the fat guy she stabbed when she was with the hound 
4538,gameofthrones, theory   warning  i am using references from both the show and the book currently  i am reading book one  have watched the entire series  i noticed some recurring dreams about the crypts between the stark family  in the show  bran has a dream that eddard is in the crypts  so he visits them once he awakens rickon and shaggydog are down there as well and says that he also had a dream about their father  without bran ever mentioning his dream to him  in the books  jon tells sam about a dream he has of the crypts and how he does nt want to go to them  but he knows he has to as i have nt gotten very far into the books  i do nt know if it ever mentions arya or sansa having a dream about them  but i believe i read somewhere  or even watched it on the show  that eddard has a dream about the crypts as well  honestly  i ca nt put together a crazy theory as to why that s happening  but i feel that it s very important the crypts are important i read somewhere about a theory of the white walkers taking winterfell because the crypts are magic  or something like that it was much more majestically worded  but i have a pretty bad memory  and i ve learned the consequences as to what happens when you put all of your eggs in one basket  so i wo nt say that it has to be true  just wondering if any of you guys have some cool theories  or just simple reasons  to explain this 
4539,gameofthrones,some speculate that winterfell serves as a prison it has hot springs so it has volcanic activity  its walls are also heated so essentially if some being of ice were to be trapped in the crypts it would be near impossible to escape  i also believe that hodor saw something down there  damaging his mind with the name of the great other being hodor the only reason to trap such a being and not kill it would be if killing is not possible if the great other is trapped down there that could also explain the unequal seasons it would also explain why the starks are the kings of winter  the physical manifestation of winter is literally their prisoner  would be a nice twist also explains what the white walkers intend to do south of the wall 
4540,gameofthrones,1 when ned s bones were returned to caitlyn while robb was fighting the lannisters i wonder if his bones ever made it back to winterfell  2 tywin lannister took ned starks sword  melted it down  then used it for two swordsone for joffrey and one for jamie so ned  if his bones were returned to winterfell  is buried without his sword  3

4542,gameofthrones,i was just re watching the show and a reached the point in season 2 where dany says that her dragons will be the only children she will ever have does this mean that she does not want another child  or does it mean that she can not bear another child  did the incident with the pyre make her infertile 
4543,gameofthrones,in the books she <URL> barren cause of a curse in book 1 but at the end of book 5 she regains the ability to have children somehow 
4544,gameofthrones,didn  t she get her period again in book 5  am i mistaken

4546,gameofthrones,yes she can have children  books confirm it 
4547,gameofthrones,sansa is found down there too after she returns to winterfell with littlefinger i do nt know where i m going with this but the crypts represent all the stark ancestors with all the madness above  and the family separateddeadetc  the crypts are like the only way for the living starks to be with their family 
4548,gameofthrones,the character is lady stoneheart  now  let me start by saying that i do not find this likely game of thrones has seemed to find its own groove and does not seem to need lady stoneheart in the mix however  it s not inconceivable  in the new teaser  i found catelyn s  quote     youtubeomra<SMILE>nozf2q  t  39s  to be particularly interesting it s  her line from s03e09     youtubessiej1rkjpm  t  1m43s  and it is a particularly vindictive one   show them how it feels to lose what they love  i find it interesting because it definitely reflects lady stoneheart s revenge obssessed character and i was wondering if this could be a clue from damp  d     do you think we ll ever get to see lady stoneheart in the show 
4549,gameofthrones,riverrun  aka lsh country  will be a major focus this season  brienne will be there and is confirmed to meet with jamie there under unfortunate circumstances  the freys are confirmed to return this season  and certain characters that lsh personally kills are casted and set to appear  theres rumors that the bwb are showing up this season  one of the special effect guys said there was a plot that was cut from season 4 and 5 that is finally happening in season 6  combine all that  with a possible hint directly from hbo in the teaser  its very very possible we will get lsh  we do nt have much in casting rumors regarding michelle fairley being on set  but keep in mind  the bwb was filmed in doors  and this is something that could easily have been concealed also keep in mind  michelle fairley does nt live that far from the filming 
4550,gameofthrones,i do nt think there s really a chance i think it would probably lessen the magnitude and significance of jon s resurrection 
4551,gameofthrones,i just do nt see it happening with the ways actors and actresses are followed nowadays  someone would have let the community know that the actress who plays lsh was present when shooting 
4552,gameofthrones,one thing s for sure  it s now or never all of the pieces seem to be in place personally  i d love to see it happen  but i m leaning on the less likely side 
4553,gameofthrones,as people hated that s5 was too much different from books  i think that if damp  d can learn from their mistakes  they will try to return it to be closer to books in s6 as there will be riverrun plotline  there could as well add lsh in  just as in the books  i personaly have feeling that all those dead characters  that had lines in teaser will have big inpact this season   theorytinfoil    g  ned will probably be in important flashbacks  catgt  lsh  rob it could be something from that time when he wanted to make jon legal stark  joffrey it will be either that cersei will start acting as joffrey or that he is head of robert strong  jon nuff said  
4554,gameofthrones,i do nt think so the whole theme of the trailers has been basically  the past is already written  so  i think that the characters we saw in the hall of faces are going to be in flashbacks through bran  perhaps played by other younger actors  and that the main plotlines will be impacted by characters gaining knowledge and insight from past events  edit  clarity
4555,gameofthrones,i personally think it would be awesome if lsh amp  jon both came back if anything just to finally make peace with one another since catelyn stark never truly accepted jon as a stark at least not in the tv version  have nt read the books  
4556,gameofthrones,100  confirmed lsh appears in season 6  i ca nt say anymore 
4557,gameofthrones,no  lsh wo nt be in the show

4559,gameofthrones,i hope not lsh was never good 
4560,gameofthrones,i believe that winterfell is named so because this is where  winter fell   as in where the ww were defeated and a pact was signed  when bran the builder raised the wall  with the intent of keeping out the ww  he probably knew that the ww would attack again so he had the crypts built and started the tradition of burying starks down there  and here s the other thing starks are buried  not burned and they are buried with their swords  which brings us to my theory  when the ww take winterfell  every dead stark will rise  not as a wight  but something like lsh they ll remember who they were  take their swords and fight the hordes

4564,gameofthrones,omg  your new idea gave me another new idea  maybe john snow is a targaryen

4568,gameofthrones,what an original theory that literally hundreds of people before you have posted 
4569,gameofthrones,are you serious about rodrick  he s most certainly not ned starks father he is the master of arms in winterfell  though a loyal to the family  no stark blood in him homie

4572,gameofthrones,preston jacobs has a neat series on youtube that deals with this topic   <URL>  list  plcsx_ofeyh6tun_7b5bwch37yslnzsr4
4573,gameofthrones,that will be little finger season 7 if my predictions are correct 
4574,gameofthrones,my silly little theory is that azor ahai has nt been born yet  and that sansa  who s speculated to be pregnant  is carrying him it s more than likely jon  or the nights watch or sam 
4575,gameofthrones,new theory my friend and i came up with for how jon snow will come back  not sure if someone mentioned this before or not    jon snow reborn as azor ahai  lady melisandre will burn jon snow s body and he will come back alivewalk out of the fire  similar to daenerys did in the past with the dragon eggs   jon snow  s sword  longclaw  will be burned with him so instead of going in with dragon eggs and coming out with baby dragons  jon snow  s sword will somehow warp into  lightbringer  aside  since stannis s sword was nt the true lightbringer maester aemon targaryen   the sword is wrong  she has to know that  light without heat  an empty glamour  the sword is wrong  and the false light can only lead us deeper into darkness  thus making jon snow the  warrior of fireson of fire  azor ahai  the legendary hero who is prophesied to fight the great otherwhite walkers 
4576,gameofthrones,ha ha  because ikea furniture can sometimes be confusing to assemble and game of thrones 
4577,gameofthrones,i think you pretty much nailed it there s a lot of evidence that jon is azor ahai ca nt wait to read see it
4578,gameofthrones,i m always so jealous of people who can do this with their hands this looks awesome 
4579,gameofthrones,just found out reek s torture was much worse in the books to where his hair turned white from malnutrition and was hardly recognizable  thought more info like that would be cool
4580,gameofthrones,i think ramsay s introduction in the books is so much better than in the show  in the books  before theon captures winterfell  bran hears word of ramsay snow taking over the castle of a woman whose husband had recently died and who had no male heirs he forces this woman to marry her and locks her in a tower bran sends a group of men to capture ramsay and his men when the group returns  they return with a boy named reek  ramsay s servant according to them  they killed ramsay and his men and were able to take reek prisoner so they lock him in the prison in winterfell  later  after theon takes winterfell  he frees this reek  and it is actually this reek  who suggests that theon kill the two miller s boys and pass them off as bran and rickon after winterfell is surrounded  reek  convinces theon to let him go to the dreadfort with a sack of money  to return with reinforcements theon agrees when reek  returns  however  he slaughters the northmen surrounding winterfell and reveals himself to have been ramsay all along he switched clothes with the real reek  who was killed in his place ramsay and his men then sack winterfell and ramsay takes theon as his personal prisoner and turns him into the new reek 
4581,gameofthrones,i feel like overall the show has done a pretty good job streamlining some things but the iron born have been left out overall although that ll be rectified somewhat with the new season 
4582,gameofthrones,in the books arya does nt use one of her death wishes to kill the tickler  the man who tortures everyone at harrenhal   she kills him herself later  while she and the hound fight men at the inn she stabs him multiple times while repeating his questions   is there gold hidden in the village  is there silver  gems  is there food  where is lord beric  where did he go  how many men were with him  how many knights  how many bowmen  how many how many how many   all that while stabbing him  so much that sandor had to drag her off his corpse 
4583,gameofthrones,the sack of winterfell  where  acok spoiler    b  rodrik was still alive by the end  leading a northern force to take back winterfell  and let ramsay s bolton force join them  and ramsay betrayed and slaughtered them all with the advantage of surprise before proceeding to burn winterfell and kill everyone but hostages   where  in the show  rodrik was killed early on  and the ironborn betrayed theon and gave him to ramsay  patchface and his underthewater prophecies  although i think shireen sang one of them in the show  and the ghost of high hill and her dreamed prophecies the battle of the fist of the first men  which still happened in the show  just not onscreen  cgi budget had already been used  but it would still have been cool to see as a season 2 finale or something  coldhands  the lady stoneheart twist  balon greyjoy s death  euronvictarion greyjoy  edric storm  etc 
4584,gameofthrones, edd  fetch me a block   cuz janos slynt was the son of a butcher hurr hurr  get it 
4585,gameofthrones,i see i got a ton of downvotes at the bottom of the page for asking if he had read any of the books it was a completely legit question and not a dick move i was gon na list the characters he missed out on cause the show cut them if he would have answered me  i would have known who to list but instead instant downvotes  lady stoneheart coldhands strong belwas arianne quentyn look em up

4587,gameofthrones,they can just roll with it bran is a growing boy 
4588,gameofthrones,why would they ignore or mask it  he would be 15 in season 6 believe it or not there are 15 year olds who are 59 
4589,gameofthrones,well  for one he s a growing boy in this world amp  theirs two  they are going to have him experience the visions by being able to walk through the enviroment  thus he ll be able to walk i think of it as the matrix in reality you re  bleh but once you get jacked into it  your physical self <URL> what your mind sees itself as  thus bran will be walking around  with a haircut  btw 
4590,gameofthrones,they ll ignore it like they did from season 34 i guess it s convenient that he never stands 
4591,gameofthrones,he is 511 now and they do nt need to mask because bran is about 15 now 
4592,gameofthrones,he s a cripple he s not going to stand up a whole lot 
4593,gameofthrones,hair cut 
4594,gameofthrones,bran will be interwoven into a weirwood tree viewers wont see his body in the show when we see him at winterfell it is a vision that the three eyed raven is taking him on  so yeah  he will be standing  but it will be a mirage of sorts  i d think that during the course of an episode we see him begin getting wrapped up by a tree and rapidly age to the present time in the story 
4595,gameofthrones,this is a reminder that theories still need to be tagged in this thread this post has an  all spoilers  title warning  but no  theory  warning spoilers from the books and show are fine without tags  but    major theory comments need green speculation spoiler tags       <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide   if you are unsure how to tag your comment  the  spoiler guide     <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide  has examples of the markup you can use   i am a bot  and this action was performed automatically please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   <URL>  to  rgameofthrones  if you have any questions or concerns 
4596,gameofthrones,up vote because it looks awesome mainly because the very first pic is of the final finished product 
4597,gameofthrones,illyrio  the guy with the beard who was looking after dany and her brother is also looking after a young man named young griff he and everyone around him claim he is the surviving son of dany s older brother rhaegar  which would make the young man aegon targaryen rightful heir to the throne and if you believe rl  j would make him jon snows half brother so his very existence throws a wrench into everything intriguing stuff 
4598,gameofthrones,remember in season 1  tyrion told a story about a peasant girl  tysha  jaime and he had saved  and which he secretely married tywin made jaime admit that it was an act jaime made up so tyrion could have his first woman it ends with tywin making tyrion and the entire garrison rape her  leaving tyrion devastated and convinced no one will ever love him  in the books  when jaime rescues tyrion after the trial by combat  he admits that it was not an act  and that tysha really did love him this leaves tyrion devastated once more  and they depart on very bad terms because of it  even with tyrion falsely admitting to killing joffrey to piss off jaime in fact  while travelling to mereen  tyrion thoughts are often preoccupied with her  as a fun theory to add to this  in braavos there is described by arya a prostitute who makes her costumers marry her for one night it his been theorized that this is in fact tysha 
4599,gameofthrones,better call the people who made the hobbits 
4600,gameofthrones,are nt they all kind of destroyed right now  especially in the show  stark  ned dead  his father rodrick too  his sister lyanna too  his brother brandon too  his brother benjen is gone  his wife catelyn is dead  his son robb the king in the north is dead  along with his wife talisa and his child and even his wolf  5 children remain but they re all believed dead except for sansa who is well sansa lannister for the south and sansa bolton for the north  they may get a proper comeback though  it must be season 6 main plot right now  boltons rule  tully  catelyn is dead  her father too  so as far as i know we have edmure as a hostage poor brynden tully will most certainly face a siege by the freys for now  the riverlands are rulled by the freys the boltonsfreys alliance really replaced the starktully one  arryn  well  jon arryn is dead and lysa is dead  so there is robin  a retarded child basically the power of the vale belongs to littlefinger now  baratheon  renly is dead stannis is dead with his family and allies  robert s name is carried by the current king  tommen baratheon who is in fact a lannister incestuous son as more and more people know about the incest  baratheon name is basically gone keep rowing gendry  tyrell  the brother and the sister  queen  are in jail  i think loras will die this season as well as mace and possibly grandma olenna loras  brothers are nt even mentionned in the show id say their credibility is gone same as lannisters  their fight brought them down together  martells  well  they may be in the best position right now  they managed to stay out of the conflict until season 4 so the majority of their power is still there but despite prince doran patience they lately took part in the war too with quentin dead  not even in the show  and aryanne not existing in the show  they may end just like the others  lannister  tywin is dead he was the lannisters  then  what do we have  3 children 1 killed his father  and officialy his nephewking  and is now on the run  the two other are a mad queen who just lost what she had  political power   and un onehanded kingslayer  who ca nt inherit lands nor marry  who by the way fucked the said mad queen and got 3 incestuous bastards the first was mad and is dead  the second was beautiful and is dead  and the third one has the will of a ronflex in a kfc out of chickens  they re being destroyed allong with their tyrell rivals by the high sparrow amp  co   amp  co  including cousin lancel  who ca nt inherit and fucked the queen too poor kevan despite being the last  respectable and capable  lannister has no heir  and will probably die in the show like in the books im having a hard time listing all the reasons this family is fucked still  they re my favorite family and i m sad  and well  house targaryen does not even has lands at this point maybe dany could get along with the martells and take dragonstone and the stormlands but for now they re not part of the seven kingdoms  if i were some throne player  i d ask myself if i d really want to get those 7 shitdoms right now  do you think cousins of cousins and forgotten bastards can carry the greatest names or do you think the  7 kingdoms  will belong to other families 
4601,gameofthrones,i think danny said it best about the  wheel  of all the big 7 houses playing their  game of thrones   she wants to  break the wheel  
4602,gameofthrones,i have a question is stannis death confirmed  it was never mentioned that he is really dead right  also where is gendry right now  do you guys think he will comeback in season 6  i really like him and i think he will turn some things around 
4603,gameofthrones,kevan has other sons it s not just lancel 
4604,gameofthrones,i have only one prediction about what is going to happen from adwd at some point  arya will kill cersei and it will be a sweet  sweet thing when it happens  
4605,gameofthrones,ok i m gon na try to take this family by family  edit  fyi rickard was ned s father  not rodrick starks  sansa  arya  bran  rickon  jon     and jeyne  robb s wife  is pregnant if i m not mistaken this is the main protaganist family and at the very least i expect sansa  bran  as a tree   and rickon to live through our story so their line can continue  tully  the blackfish and edmure are alive and i expect edmure to live why would the freys kill him when they married him into the family blackfish is childless and unmarried but that can change  arryn  this is the one family i do think is probably gon na get wiped out do nt see sweet robin making it harold hardyng is a decedent of the arryn line and he may yet survive but he does nt have the arryn name  baratheon  we know gendry and edric are both still alive i m sure there are other unknown bastards as well all they need is legitimization and i ll add that stannis is nt book dead  and is like the only death ever not shown on tv show deaths tend to be very graphic as soon as it cut away i was like  damn  brienne decided not to do it   so there s a chance he still lives  tyrells  lot of tyrells left mace has like 4 kids  all of whom are still alive if i m not mistaken i do expect mace to die though mace also had a sister marry into the redwynes there is plenty of opportunity for the tyrells to come out of this with the line intact  martells  arianne and trystane are still alive and oberyn has a ton of sand snakes just takes someone to legitimize one of them and the martells are the one family who allows a woman to rule i think they are probably the safest  even if arianne and trystane die  lannisters  kevan lannister has 3 living children if i m not mistaken lancel  prolly dies   martyn  given back by robb stark   and janei the youngest tywin also had a sister named genna who is currently married into house frey i tend to think at minimum martyn lives  targs  dany will make it to the last book but might not live  jon snow     and faegon targs have a high probability of being wiped out  especially if jon and aegon are nt targs  greyjoys  theon  asha  euron  victarion  and aeron at minimum theon has no cock so forget him the uncles are all childless as far as i know i think asha will survive though may be the first women to rule the iron islands if i made any mistakes please let me know
4606,gameofthrones,that s why it s called a feast for crows  they re all dead the war destroyed everything 
4607,gameofthrones,with the arryns it s also important to remember the possibility of robin being littlefinger s child if that is the case  then the  true  arryns may already be lost 
4608,gameofthrones, theory warning    g  i do nt think they will have time to reproduce  soon there will be a war so probably no   
4609,gameofthrones,tr  n
4610,gameofthrones,i never understand this ikea circlejerk i bought a computer desk and a couple chairs before  and i had no problem fellowing their instructions 
4611,gameofthrones,same place  and by the same little bastard 
4612,gameofthrones,now which targ is that  almost  the image shows almost all targ kings in their prime
4613,gameofthrones,the nightfort has nt been manned for centuries so it does nt seem like people know anymore  sam had to read about it in a book and it s not like the rest of the watch is in there reading with him at best the talking door none of them have seen is just another magic rumor 
4614,gameofthrones,i want to believe
4615,gameofthrones, ahem     wwwteeteeeuappuploads201503design_20140603115<SMILE>14jpg 
4616,gameofthrones,tools required  flathead screwdriver hammer dragon
4617,gameofthrones, in instructions it says that there should be 1000 pieces  but i only got 200 of them 
4618,gameofthrones,i m not fully up to date with the books  but at what point does thor sit on the iron throne 
4619,gameofthrones, only one course of action remains     <URL>  damn   his was better     <URL> 
4620,gameofthrones,how much money is 1000 gold dragons  that seems like a lot
4621,gameofthrones,should ve gone with the k  nen
4622,gameofthrones,and you always end up with like 3 extra swords you just put in the junk drawer because you ca nt figure out where they are supposed to go  also life pro tip tape the included allen wrench to the bottom of the throne so you ll know where it is in case you need to disassemble the throne
4623,gameofthrones,that s gon na be a lot of little wooden dowels
4624,gameofthrones,yeah  thats one fine looking iron throne  why does nt mine look like that    
4625,gameofthrones,ca nt even imagine the look on his face for the book s version
4626,gameofthrones,should have paid the iron price
4627,gameofthrones,we ve heard 1000 theories about how jon snow might returnand i know kit harrington has been seen on set but can i have a couple of opinions on how likely it is that he wo nt come back 
4628,gameofthrones,hey everyone  so my cousin is actually finally getting into the hbo series and he just got to the end of season 1 and already was flipping out about the ending aside from the red wedding and viper v mountain scene  what other episodes would you <URL> that i should prep him to set up a camera to record his reaction 
4629,gameofthrones,hound v breinne
4630,gameofthrones,i hope you re going to post them  we ve been in need of some good reactions 
4631,gameofthrones,59 drogon arrives might be lost a little since your buddy is binge watching  but for a lot of us  we spent years after those little dragons were born  waiting  just waiting for when we d finally get to see one seriously wreck some shit as a big monster 
4632,gameofthrones,neither sandor or gregor were there so they are nt dead  cleganebowl 2016 hype        s
4633,gameofthrones,so that s why kit harrington was on set
4634,gameofthrones,i think i saw roose bolton among the faces 
4635,gameofthrones,we lost lefty but his wheelchair lives on 
4636,gameofthrones,the tommenser pounce bromance really does it for me 
4637,gameofthrones,yeah it s nothing more than hype building i m cracking up at the people trying to read into the position of the faces 
4638,gameofthrones,all i m picturing now is  spoiler text   jake s head on a spike  still cool though   
4639,gameofthrones,1 they gave ww boys so craster reign would last and have no heirs 4 id assume no bc the ww prolly did nt kill them bc they knew they would bring them more babies 
4640,gameofthrones,thank god this is just balon  i thought this was gon na be about the obvious ser pounce pregnancy and the birth of azor ahai 
4641,gameofthrones,awww i wonder who the father is  
4642,gameofthrones,will aegon targaryen make a show appearance or has dany absorbed him at this point so to speak  seems like a missed opportunity because he would add a great dynamic to the show and to the claim to the throne 
4643,gameofthrones,i highly doubt he ll make the show there s so much of that storyline they ve already missed and ca nt really do anymore  and i think the show is going with dany to be the only one invading westeros they ve already given jon connington s greyscale to jorah 
4644,gameofthrones,with how varys regards dany i think it s safe to assume that she s taken his role 
4645,gameofthrones,aegon blackfyre 
4646,gameofthrones,interestingly he also had no intention of putting actual dragons into the story and had to be talked into it does that mean they re not as important as we think they are  probably not  but it s an interesting thing of note also  the first book agot povs were it he had no plans to add other povs there were <SMILE> in agot and 6 of them were starks  other 2 were tyrion and dany   not that it s a surprise the starks are incredibly important  but this drives the point home 
4647,gameofthrones,has no one noticed the music used in the background before it reaches the wall with tyrionsaryas etc faces  it s the music in the hard home episode when the ww are massacring everyone the other side of the gate surely that s some implication that this trailer is aimed at the ww in some way  i m not really sure how to explain it but that must implicate something considering only one character here has fought the white walkers
4648,gameofthrones,  teaser  
4649,gameofthrones,this is a reminder that theories still need to be tagged in this thread this post has an  all spoilers  title warning  but no  theory  warning spoilers from the books and show are fine without tags  but    major theory comments need green speculation spoiler tags       <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide   if you are unsure how to tag your comment  the  spoiler guide     <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide  has examples of the markup you can use   i am a bot  and this action was performed automatically please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   <URL>  to  rgameofthrones  if you have any questions or concerns 
4650,gameofthrones,nice catch i need to rewatch the series so i can pick up on stuff like this better  probably some people noticed but thought it was kind of obvious why but i m glad you shared i think it s definitely supposed to tie in to how very soon  we re led to believe  the winter will be coming for everyone and they will all be affected
4651,gameofthrones,i noticed i think they only used it because it sounds cool 
4652,gameofthrones,what if the writers bran stark any mention of jon snow for at least the first episode  i feel like the writers are enjoying themselves at the watchers  pun not intended  expense  teaser 1     <URL>  v  ixi<SMILE>apisq<SMILE>i  shows jon snow possibly being taken by bran  jon is still alive the  second teaser     <URL>  v  omra<SMILE>nozf2q  shows already dead people  but then adds jon snow to the list  and first impression you start cursing but then you see people who are alive in the show i guess that is the whole idea behind teasers  the teasers do a great job bringing my interest back to game of thrones now back to the discussion back to the begging  what if they emit jon snow from the very first episode and continue the jon snow anger 
4653,gameofthrones,personally  i think they shot themselves in the foot when they staged jon s  death  as the season finale by doing that  they condemned themselves to a year of fans not wondering  if  jon snow would return  but  when  he would return  which makes the cliffhanger an empty threat what s done is done  though  if they held off on a jon snow reveal  his absence at least sinks in a bit and the other storylines are allowed to breathe however  they run the risk of fans saying  when will they hurry up and bring jon snow back  nothing else in the show seems important right now  unfortunately  the show is going to have to do a lot of setup again  because all the storylines reached a climax together and will each need resetting  dany meeting the dothraki  the new dynamic in king s landing  sam in oldtown  bran s return  sansa and theon sorting out their shit   on the other hand  an early jon snow revival would give the season an early rush of momentum  which would counteract the dullness of setting up the other storylines  tl  dr  it s a catch22 whether he comes back sooner or later 
4654,gameofthrones,could be a case of putting to much into the show  and it may indicate the storyline does nt go anywhere  as much as i loved it in the books i ca nt see it in the show  its too convoluted and seems they have much bigger fish to fry
4655,gameofthrones,the bear and the maiden fair specifically the version played at the red wedding when the bedding ceremony begins  but i ca nt find it anywhere

4661,gameofthrones,yes  its at 1  59am gmt
4662,gameofthrones,no  no trailer today there will be a teaser though 
4663,gameofthrones,rofl that jake head on the hilt of the blade  too good
4664,gameofthrones,this sounds amazing  also  going by their track record it ll pretty much be skyrim with  uh  swords  and uh  dragons  and stuff 
4665,gameofthrones,well as long as she plotted her cycle it wont be a red wedding
4666,gameofthrones,for the three people who do nt know  season 1 episode 10 joffrey makes sansa look at her fathers head  which was placed among a few others one of those heads belonged to george w bush  which was apparently an accident this caused a big controversy  bla bla  apologies were made  and everyone eventually forgot about it  apart from every  top 10 facts about game of thrones  ever   so  in season 3 episode 10  tyrion threatens joffrey at the small council  after learning of the stark s defeat at the twins grand maester pycelle goes on to say    lord tyrion should apologize immediately     unacceptable  disrespectful and in very bad taste       i always found this line to be somewhat amusing  until i very recently found out that that was actually what hbo had to say about the george w bush thing in season 1 i quote  gt    we were deeply dismayed to see this and find it     unacceptable  disrespectful and in very bad taste     we made this clear to the executive producers of the series who apologized immediately for this inadvertent  careless mistake we are sorry this happened and will have it removed from any future dvd production   a press release made by hbo  apologizing profusely when they learned that the season 1 finale of game of thrones inadvertently included a shot of a prop head of president george w bush impaled on a spike  i just friggin love how exactly two seasons later  after a similar event  major character dies a shocking death one episode prior   they actually threw in a line referencing that controversy 
4667,gameofthrones,nice catch seems like a pretty major easter egg i m surprised more people had nt noticed already
4668,gameofthrones,i hope she s not pregnant 
4669,gameofthrones,booksmasher   
4670,gameofthrones,wait wait wait seriously  does anyone have a screenshot of the head  would it be on my dvd or has it been edited before release 
4671,gameofthrones,nice emblem   dont worry the freys have no idea   
4672,gameofthrones,if you hear the rains of castamere  head for the nearest exit 
4673,gameofthrones,that was the gayest thing i ve ever seen 
4674,gameofthrones,arya s time in harrenhal just as the lannister army leaves  a big group of northern prisoners arrive in the book arya uses the last death that jaqen owes her to help her kill the dungeon guards and free the prisoners who go on to kill the small garrison of lannisters left behind robb s little sister just helped him capture one of the most important castles in the war and he never learns it was her who did it  
4675,gameofthrones,most swords of high born people have names  but i would want long claw it seems reslly cool and that wolf handle is pretty sick 
4676,gameofthrones,it s not standing anywhere near where jon killed the ww  he killed it 20 ft away from the hut  then him tormund  edd and wun wun ran for over a minute to the water front where they got on the boat  jones murdered ww was hundreds of yards away  as for why it looks like the same ww they all tend to look like that  it s only the nights king that looks different 
4677,gameofthrones,excellent  the next step is kill all the other members of the league no one else plays you automatically win remember me when you come into your throne my lord 
4678,gameofthrones,i noticed this when i rewatched season 2 a few months ago  and i was like  holy shit   ooo
4679,gameofthrones,you were supposed to use the swords of the defeated players to make the throne 
4680,gameofthrones,with ghost the wolf and jon the human 
4681,gameofthrones,may the odds be ever in your favor    wait  that does nt seem right  all men must die  i guess seriously tho  awesome work 
4682,gameofthrones,all 3 of dany s dragons are male and all have male names  so how will they reproduce  i assume that the dragons are hermaphrodites and that they can change their sex from male to female i have not read the books  but is it mentioned if the dragons will reproduce in the books 
4683,gameofthrones,if you look closely at this you can clearly see the white walker that jon just defeated brought back from life and standing where he was killed thoughts    <URL>  format  1500w   <URL>  v  qk_fywqlccm at 3  42
4684,gameofthrones,the only thing that imo remains the same is the major role that jon plays in asoiaf  the draft  the hints  does nt mean that the end will be good for him  i believe in jon and dany <URL> enemies 
4685,gameofthrones,all i m picturing now is  spoiler text   jake s head on a spike  still cool though   
4686,gameofthrones,unfortunately it still does nt tell us very much because if we are going to have a discussion it has to be about the specifics  and as we know many of those have changed so 
4687,gameofthrones,if they do reproduce  or if more dragon eggs are found and birthed  it could be complete chaos think of dragons everywhere setting fire to everything it would be great if they could be sent to annihilate the white walkers  but i do nt know if dragon fire kills them 
4688,gameofthrones, in the books  doran  prince of dorne  has a daughter and a son besides trystane the daughter s name is arianne and the son s name is quentyn the daughter is real hbo material  rebellious  overly sexual  gorgeous  cunning  but her whole sideplot seems to have been cut which is why the few things outside of that plot seem to have been moved to ellaria  oberyn s paramour  this is an image of her that grrm likes     <URL>   also  since dorne is a little more egalitarian than the rest of westeros  she is the heir  as she is older than both trystane and quentyn   in the books  gendry flirst with a barmaid and arya gets a little jealous the barmaid claims to be a bastard of king robert arya admits that she does have the king s black curly hair  but argues that lots of people have that hair  like for example gendry  who we of course know is a bastard of robert    he does nt    grrm likes incest i guess   maester aemon s little brother  aegon  who is dany s grandfather in the show  greatgrandfather in the books  they cut out a generation   aka the father of the mad king  was kind of a middle ages socialist who tried to take power away from the lords and give it to the people obviously the lords were nt thrilled he had been a squire to a humble knight in his youth because his father the fourth son of the king and aegon was the fourth son of the fourth son  so no one expected him to inherit a plague  some vows  and some good old fashioned targaryen madness made him king because of this he is called aegon the unlikely he became obsessed with dragons and tried to hatch some dragon eggs thinking that if he had the ultimate power  he could <URL> the lords  but something went wrong and everyone who was there died except dany s parents  the mad king and his sisterwife   grrm really does like incest   dany s mother was heavily pregnant and gave birth that day  to prince rhaegar targaryen  the man who robert killed for taking lyanna stark  ned s sister   in the books  dany and tyrion still have nt met   in the books  jon and arya and ned  and lyanna  all look a lot alike  and cat and her other children all look like tullys  red hair  blue eyes   this is an additional reason why cat hates jon  he s the only boy who really looks like ned   everyone is related once you look at family trees dany s grandfather aegon the unlikely  mentioned above  married someone from the blackwood family ned stark s great grandmother was also a blackwood so ned and dany share blood jorah mormont married the sister of sam tarly s mother robert s dad and dany s dad were cousins 
4689,gameofthrones,i m rewatching the series right now  and just watched the episode with stannis  shadow baby assassinating renly my question is  had renly not been assassinated  and had he fought his brother the next day as he planned  who would have won  i have to imagine it would be renly just by sheer numbers now i do nt remember them mentioning the size of stannis  army  but i do nt think it could compete with the 100000 his renly had 
4690,gameofthrones,renly was primed to take the entire continent 
4691,gameofthrones,renly easily had the largest army of all the five kings stannis s was small 
4692,gameofthrones,stannis actually says   grinds teeth  i can not defeat my brother in the field   to melisandre iirc  that s when she seduces him to make the shadow baby
4693,gameofthrones,no doubt stannis would be crushed in the field renly would siege king s landing and realize how piss poor the garrison is  and would take the city in no time  stannis would be grining his teeth on dragonstone while tywin s head is spiked by robb in the west renly would no doubt return sansa to robb as a gesture of good faith  and arya would in time make it to riverrun to reunite with her family  hoping she escapes harrenhall in one piece  so pretty much if renly lived  good guys win  most likely i mean  anything  could  happen  like magic shadowbabies  which actually did happen that absolutely no one could have ever predicted  
4694,gameofthrones,my take is renly would ve won a resounding tactical victory  but i do nt think he could ve sealed the strategic deal stannis probably escapes back to dragonstone and keeps his navy  or at least the ships  or at least most of them   since he d still be able to harry the south  renly ca nt attack king s landing  as that would expose his back the war of five kings lasts a lot longer as nobody s really in a position to attack anyone  with the exception of robb stark being left all but alone against tywin  the good news is  that also means the red wedding never happens  ramsay recaptures winterfell and that whole war plays out about the same  and roose has to capitalize on that with robb rather than with tywin 
4695,gameofthrones,not only did renly have the numbers but he also had knits such as loras tyrell and brienne the beauty but he also had randyll tarly who if i remember correctly  one of the best commanders so yes  renly would have won but his forces would have taken a huge hit but probably would have had an even larger navy if saalador saan had gone to renly s cause 
4696,gameofthrones,i d love to see an animated series that is basically a page for page adaptation of the books 
4697,gameofthrones,i hope that s so they re less attached and can have other riders as she s clearly been most attached to drogon from the start 
4698,gameofthrones,the scene where dany is in the house of undying  she all but sees the red wedding a man with a wolf head sitting on a throne while dead lay at his feet
4699,gameofthrones,to continue on the theme of ramsay and reek  you may already be aware of this given you came upon some info about reek s torture   ramsay s treatment of his bride is also significantly worse in the books  in the show  ramsay has rather forcible sex with his bride sansa while making reek watch  we d certainly call this marital rape in modern culture  but many have suggested that  in the universe of the show  sansa has to have known that she d have to have sex with ramsay upon marrying him making reek watch was certainly fucked up  but  in the books  ramsay does nt just make reek watch him have sex with his bride  jeyne poole serving as an arya imposter in the books  but he makes reek  prepare  his bride for him by performing cunnilingus on her  honestly when i was watching the episode where sansa marries ramsay  my heart was in my throat dreading the bedroom scene  and i was actually fairly relieved they toned it down significantly 
4700,gameofthrones,he was king joffrey
4701,gameofthrones,always wondered what the heck quaithe is anyway 
4702,gameofthrones,in the books  catelyn grabs a halfwit frey named jinglebell and threatens to kill him if they do nt let robb go and keep her as hostage instead in fact  they had planned all along to keep her as hostage given that her uncle brynden was nt at the wedding  while he did survive in the show  it was because he slipped out for a piss i believe   but after robb died she went mad  scratched her cheeks off that they decided to off her it s interesting because you read it from her perspective  because of this you see where the motivation for the lady stoneheart character comes from  the line from the new teaser gives me hope she will yet appear 
4703,gameofthrones,i believe it s a reference to aegon the conqueror and his sisters
4704,gameofthrones,night s watch time  come on grab your crows 
4705,gameofthrones,theory  she only has control of drogon because the other  two heads of the dragon  will control rhaegal and viserion 
4706,gameofthrones,ca nt wait for the   oh   scene in the show  wondering how they will do it 
4707,gameofthrones,do u want to build a snow castle 
4708,gameofthrones,i think it s heavily implied that valyrian steel can kill the white walkers obsidian  or dragon glass  is rock that has been melted by dragon fire it s confirmed that this can kill the white walkers also showing valyrian steel kill a white walker adds to the theory that dragon fire is the key to killing the white walkers as valyrian steel was believed to have been forged in dragon fire so the series is called  a song of ice and fire  so it would make sense that the white walkers  the living embodiment of ice  can be counteredkilled by dragons  the living embodiment of fire  i firmly believe that we are going to see the white walkers breach the wall and move south on westeros the seven kingdoms will unite to try and fight them but they will ultimately fail daenerys will arrive in westeros with her army and dragons however no body will support her because the targaryens left a bad taste in the mouth of westeros however she will ultimately do battle against the white walkers with her dragons and possibly new valyrian steel forged with her dragons and save the 7 kingdoms from the white walkers thus giving her the love and support of the people and a solid claim to the iron throne 
4709,gameofthrones,i ve been wondering if dragon fire can kill white walkers  anyone know 
4710,gameofthrones,personally  i think they shot themselves in the foot when they staged jon s  death  as the season finale by doing that  they condemned themselves to a year of fans not wondering  if  jon snow would return  but  when  he would return  which makes the cliffhanger an empty threat what s done is done  though  if they held off on a jon snow reveal  his absence at least sinks in a bit and the other storylines are allowed to breathe however  they run the risk of fans saying  when will they hurry up and bring jon snow back  nothing else in the show seems important right now  unfortunately  the show is going to have to do a lot of setup again  because all the storylines reached a climax together and will each need resetting  dany meeting the dothraki  the new dynamic in king s landing  sam in oldtown  bran s return  sansa and theon sorting out their shit   on the other hand  an early jon snow revival would give the season an early rush of momentum  which would counteract the dullness of setting up the other storylines  tl  dr  it s a catch22 whether he comes back sooner or later 
4711,gameofthrones,just hype  all men must die  i think they saw that amazing arya fanart and were inspired but i dont think it tranalated well into a trailer because people are taking it seriously 
4712,gameofthrones,if they decided to address it at all   the green seer process accelerates the aging process  or something or other 
4713,gameofthrones,can you  or someone else  make an background of this picture  this is pretty good   
4714,gameofthrones,more please  
4715,gameofthrones,renly wound win easily  it would just delay his taking of king s landing a few days if he killedcaptured stannis and robb honored the deal catelyn had made with renly
4716,gameofthrones,does this question really need  another  thread 
4717,gameofthrones,illegitimacy in season 2 joffery asks his mother about it but she dismisses it saying that their enemies will say anything to weaken his claim but in season 3 when sansa was about to leave the wedding feast joffery tells her  i suppose it does nt really matter which   lannister   puts the baby into you maybe i ll pay you a visit after my uncle passes out  he does nt consider himself as baratheon even though he is stylized as joffery i baratheon  just a little speculation i made 
4718,gameofthrones,most of us were beyond disappointed that got did nt release any new footage during their  teaser   when do you guys expect a trailer to be released  a week  two  a month  idk 
4719,gameofthrones,life is funny when you eat dinner with your banker given the real power balance he saw growing up  the massive influence of the lannisters on his father  he prefers to be associated with what he perceived as power over lineage he had the lineage in his back pocket  or so he saw   but he preferred to flaunt power 
4720,gameofthrones,i see the sorting hat also attended this skirmish 
4721,gameofthrones,i was under the impression that frankenmountain still had his original head was that wrong to assume 
4722,gameofthrones,1 they gave ww boys so craster reign would last and have no heirs 4 id assume no bc the ww prolly did nt kill them bc they knew they would bring them more babies 
4723,gameofthrones,season 2 for sure episode 5 or 6
4724,gameofthrones,i think it s simply  look  here are all these dead characters remember them  oh and here are some characters you love that can die too  possibly 
4725,gameofthrones,here s a thought  they appear in the order in which they died 
4726,gameofthrones,waldron 
4727,gameofthrones,our six players the top half will live  the bottom half will die 
4728,gameofthrones,i can say that they will all die eventually but the fact they are in the teaser in the halls is a key clue  we will see them die all the faces shown were characters we saw on the show die  jon snow chief among them it is very much saying to the viewers  no character is safe  ontop of this  we can assume that only two characters in the series are capable of viewing the halls of the many face men besides the members of the house and black and white itself  bran and arya are the only ones logically able to view the halls  that being said  arya is now blind  strengthening her other senses i can tell you now that arya and bran are going to be huge parts of the next season game changers even  and since bran has reached his destination in the series  we can assume he will grow stronger jon snow  even though everyone says he will be alive  it would be at the expense of the story to bring him back alive he will likely come back in a flashback  seeing him in the halls confirms he is dead since the people who are truly dead spoke quotes  who knows  i could be wrong i personally hope he lives but all the characters who died were the only ones to speak  joffrey  ned  catelyn  robb and jon 
4729,gameofthrones,did nt catch this on my first time watching i want jorah to survive and given the foreshadowing  i d say this could be legit here s hoping at least 
4730,gameofthrones,considering the amount of foreshadowing in the show and a mereenese red priestess being cast this season maybe 
4731,gameofthrones,it s thought that valyrian steel swords may have been forged with the aid of dragon fire which is what gives it the certain magical properties allowing it to kill white walkers similar to dragon glass 
4732,gameofthrones,bran the breaker had a twin brother also named brandon who would became the night s king  tying the stark lineage to the white walkers and the theme of ice  even more  
4733,gameofthrones,he has no idea  he has just been brainwashed into being a lannister rather than a baratheon he hated his father and was conditioned by his mother since birth 
4734,gameofthrones,this is what is awesome about asoiaf everyone can die  everyone can live  george  i love you 
4735,gameofthrones,joffrey always seemed to prefer his lannister parentage  he always said he is from the house baratheon and lannister instead of just baratheon and he always dressed in the lannister colors 
4736,gameofthrones,there s the scene when jon and we learn that craster s boy babies are being given to the white walkers  so it made me wonder  1 do the white walkers only want boy and not girl babies   yes  craster wants to keep his  wives   but wondering if there was something else to them being all boy babies  2 do the white walkers kill the babies who would then turn into white walkers  or do they keep them alive as humans for a time  3 are white walkers who were turned as babies different or magical in some way than ones who turned as adults  4 could ever the white walkers be pacified by being given babies   since they did nt seem to ever attack craster or his daughters 
4737,gameofthrones,rewatching the show after some reveal adds so much depth to seemingly useless scenes i guess people who read the books see those first time around but some of us have to go back 
4738,gameofthrones,its a spoiler since at first season you dont know that john snow will join at nightswatch  
4739,gameofthrones,  awoiafwesterosorgindexphpdragon  reproduction dany s dragons have male names because they are named after male people  not because they are males themselves 
4740,gameofthrones,i m sure when they start to appear more in the show  you ll see more variety 
4741,gameofthrones,there were three white walker generals at hardhome along with the the nights king jon killed one so the one in the shot was one of the others there armour is the same as they are generals hence why they look similar and are different to the walkers from seasons 14 
4742,gameofthrones,wut if he were legitimate  joffrey would be a lannister and a baratheon by blood  which is what matters when getting sansa pregnant   so either way  he would believe that he is a lannister
4743,gameofthrones,first off i have nt read the books but i d assume there s more on their relationship there so hopefully someone more knowledgeable will respond  obviously they resent her currently but i ca nt imagine they will never come around to them she is their mother and i believe that s a bond that will eventually <URL> their contempt i believe eventually dany will show her sorrow for locking them up they ll all have a reunion with epic music and cinematic panorama shots of them all flying around together but maybe that s expecting too much from got
4744,gameofthrones,how can we be so sure of the sex  somebody has to go around looking up the dragons skirts 
4745,gameofthrones,i dont think its him  could be a twin wonder if they share their ww clothes  or who makes them at all  i bet its captured wildling women sowing away on leather vests and whatnot 
4746,gameofthrones,gt  and i could nt help but notice that all his broad strokes are still on point although some of the more specific storytelling may have strayed  the broad strokes still stand  meh any writer knows that once the rubber hits the proverbial road  things can change dramatically even if you keep the broad strokes  the individual specifics can change so much its entirely different situation 
4747,gameofthrones,interestingly he also had no intention of putting actual dragons into the story and had to be talked into it does that mean they re not as important as we think they are  probably not  but it s an interesting thing of note also  the first book agot povs were it he had no plans to add other povs there were <SMILE> in agot and 6 of them were starks  other 2 were tyrion and dany   not that it s a surprise the starks are incredibly important  but this drives the point home 
4748,gameofthrones,i would assume that they are all capable of reproducing at one point maestet aemon says something about dragons gender being ever changing like a flame  so even if they are all male now they might still be able to lay an egg at some point we do nt really know anything about how dragon reproduction works at all  but since they are all healthy dragons we have no reason to think that they would nt be capable of reproducing also  there are still some dragon eggs laying around in different parts of the world  even though they are pretty rare   and people were trying to hatch them as recently as rhaegar s birth i do nt think it would be too far fetched to think that danys dragons could hatch previously existing eggs even of they do nt lay eggs of their own just because humans have had no luck getting eggs to hatch does nt mean that dragons would nt be able to do it
4749,gameofthrones,the gender of a dragon is a tricky matter people refer to them as malefemale based on their own perception  but they have no visible genital organs and from the looks of it  their size also does nt matter since no dragons ever seen coupling  nobody really knows how they reproduce so far  dany s dragons are too young  so if they survive long enough  they may very well lay eggs 
4750,gameofthrones,are you sure that that is stannis  pretty weird that he died with a beard  and he s shaven in the hall of faces 
4751,gameofthrones,as of right now i have watched the series and am on the first book it got me thinking about the white walkers and where they came from and what they are is their any theories on them about where they may have originated from or how they came to be also  rewatching hardhome  when jon stopped the white walker with longclaw  valyrian steel   did the valyrians build there swords around the power to be able to stop white walkers   which would mean they had experienced them before possibly in essos   in my opinion  the white walkers are the most interesting plot and i would like to hear some theories about them 
4752,gameofthrones,what  it s just another white walker all white walkers aside from the night s king look very much alike 
4753,gameofthrones,very little is known about the white walkers  or others  as they are called in the books   according to westerosi lore  they last invaded around <SMILE>000 years ago during the long night  although the accuracy of this is disputed because it predates written history by several thousand years we know that they come from the very far north  but when and how they originated is unknown  as for stopping them  sam killed one with a dagger made of dragonglass aka obsidian valyrian steel works in the show  but has nt been tested in the books the books mention something called dragonsteel which has been used to stop them  although it is not confirmed whether this is valyrian steel since valyria was nt around <SMILE>000 years ago and dragons were nt introduced to westeros until very recently  either the accepted timeline is wrong  there was some white walker activity after the long night  or the first men acquired protovalyrian steel from another source we also know of the myth of the last hero  who ended the long night using a sword forged with a blood sacrifice this could have been the first dragonsteel sword or it could have been a unique magical occurrence valyrian steel does require blood sacrifices and fire magic  obsidian shows that firebased weapons are super effective   which would make it an ideal weapon for killing the white walkers but because we know so little about the long night  it is nt clear whether the last hero was just a guy with a really awesome sword made of technology yet to be discovered  or whether he had other abilities and his sword was mainly a symbol of his magic power 
4754,gameofthrones,all of the quotes are about death 
4755,gameofthrones,wow i did nt realize that before  that s crazy good job on pointing that out 
4756,gameofthrones,thanks natalie for confirming what we already know 
4757,gameofthrones,the way they edited jon snow s part makes it seem like a warning as though jon snow is now part of the threat to the living 
4758,gameofthrones, this     <URL>  is probably my favorite theory that i have come across on reddit a great explanation of the things we know about the others  but also a look into their possible motives 
4759,gameofthrones,haha oh my god this is actually so cool  i will have to look into contributing to this 
4760,gameofthrones,i d just like to say that the death of stannis was confirmed alongside the death of myrcella op put stannis  death as debateable
4761,gameofthrones,i m pretty certain nobody is going to sit the iron throne dany saw the throne room in ruins in her vision in season 2  and cersei s promised multiple times to burn this or that to ground for her family chekov s wildfire is still under the city in abundant quantity  supposedly 
4762,gameofthrones,i mean  i think that is sort of misunderstanding the quote the whole point is she is marrying tyrion   lannister    and she is expected to be impregnated by tyrion   lannister    jeffrey s whole point is  having lannister blood himself  could just do that himself using his authority as king  the quote just would nt make sense has he said baratheon  or anything else  because he was playing off the fact that she was marrying his relative  a lannister  edit  i put this in another comment  but i think it summarizes my point pretty well  the quote was saying  your baby is going to be born as my uncle s son into house lannister all that really matters is somebody with lannister genetics impregnates you  because even if it is nt my uncles son he is raising  it is truly a lannister by blood  whether that be through both his parents or just his mom  it would nt matter  although it is very much a point throughout the series that  through tywin s influence and robert s  i do nt care  do whatever makes my wife happy so i can live my popular lifestyle without distraction  attitude  joffrey stylized himself still very much a lannister  even if of house baratheon 
4763,gameofthrones,i just had a friend tell me that dead weirwoods  such as a door  would not be included in the  weirwood network  is there anywhere in the series or books where this is shown 
4764,gameofthrones,can anyone make out what the whispers are saying 
4765,gameofthrones,jon snow looks too happy  usually he just pouts
4766,gameofthrones,with the death of myrcella  she will go all out to protect tommen  and she will likely see the faiththe high sparrow as a threat that may make her even more volatile or reckless than she has ever been in the past this means like she will have a confrontation with the faith this season 
4767,gameofthrones,sorry for the autocorrectcaused mistake   pictures
4768,gameofthrones,grrm has stated that 5  and only 5 characters will make it to the end of the story tyrion  dany  jon  arya and bran so what you re thinking probably is nt going to happen 
4769,gameofthrones,there s also a scene in the books during tommen s wedding to margaery where cersei tells the feast that tommen and margaery s wedding would unite the powers of  casterly rock  and highgarden  the baratheons of king s landing in general identify more with their lannister ancestry then they ever will with their stormlord father  they even make their mother s house equal to their father s house in their naming and heraldry  joffrey lannisterbaratheon  
4770,gameofthrones,well robert was nt really much of a father figure either he was known for getting drunk and whoring around did nt exactly seem like he was a superinvolved father  so illegitimate or not  it s not super surprising that joffrey would identify more as a lannister
4771,gameofthrones,even his responce to cersei seems to imply that he knows  he just does nt care  it s not a claim  the throne is mine    whether or not it s true  joffrey was king  and that s all he cared about 
4772,gameofthrones,not a bad theory  but i d add that maybe the <URL> is preventable
4773,gameofthrones,in the books  they swapped gilly s son with mance s son  so that mel wo nt burn mance s son for his king s blood i have nt read the books in a while  so i do nt remember all the details  but that might be why he looks guilty beacause they re leaving gilly s child  whom he cares a great deal about  behind 
4774,gameofthrones,i think hbo liked our idea uertacaltinoz   <URL>  q  gallery  3aertacaltinoz  2f27<SMILE>2966amp  qo  6
4775,gameofthrones,him referring to himself as a lannister is nt anything telling  to me he is a lannister  even if he thought he was half barratheon he was supposed to be half of each 
4776,gameofthrones,would you not tell your best friend somebody wanted to kill them 
4777,gameofthrones,all men must die  pal 
4778,gameofthrones,i was kinda surprised not to get the privilege of hearing charles dance speak once more  is there significance to a lack of tywin 
4779,gameofthrones,i m not sure if anyone s mentioned this  but where are the stark boys in all this 
4780,gameofthrones,i always assumed joffrey s knowledge of his true parentage had a lot to do with his decision to kill ned stark  he killed ned because he knew he was right  and silencing him was crucial to keeping the throne  as ned  even disgraced and sent to the wall  still commanded enough respect to bring stannis  rob  now lord of winterfell   possibly even renly  and all the other badass  battlehardened northern houses together  not to mention dorne  who have no love for lannisters even with the boltons  the lannisters do nt stand a chance i doubt the boltons flip anyway  considering it s a losing cause  joffrey was wise to kill ned it was key to dividing the rest of westeros against each other had he let ned live  he would have lost the war of the 5 kings almost immediately ned s mutual respect in the realm holds the north together  not to mention  ned then joins jon in winterfell  and can be free to inform him of his true parentage  as was his intention  queue jon being introduced to his only living kin  dany  makes some sense why ned was so ready to defend dany from robert  now we see at least a tentative peace between nearly all significant factions in our story united to face the wwothers  of course this is crazy speculation  but you can imagine how drastically different the entire story would be 
4781,gameofthrones,i hate corrupt people in government  cersei   but i hate religious zealots even more  high sparrow   so i think i might want to see cersei get revenge 
4782,gameofthrones,no  he does nt remember in episode 10 of season 3  when they re giving tyrion the information of the red wedding  and tywin send him to bed  he screams to tywin    my father   won the real war  he killed rhaegar  while you hid under casterly rock  
4783,gameofthrones,if you remember the end of season 5 arya pulled all those masks off and revealed her own face which leads me to believe a face does nt need to be dead to be on the wall  no idea what this means  but just an observation 
4784,gameofthrones,gt  ned s head under a headsman s axe  ah you fucked it up 
4785,gameofthrones,do nt do this to me  
4786,gameofthrones,for the three people who do nt know  season 1 episode 10 joffrey makes sansa look at her fathers head  which was placed among a few others one of those heads belonged to george w bush  which was apparently an accident this caused a big controversy  bla bla  apologies were made  and everyone eventually forgot about it  apart from every  top 10 facts about game of thrones  ever   so  in season 3 episode 10  tyrion threatens joffrey at the small council  after learning of the stark s defeat at the twins grand maester pycelle goes on to say    lord tyrion should apologize immediately     unacceptable  disrespectful and in very bad taste       i always found this line to be somewhat amusing  until i very recently found out that that was actually what hbo had to say about the george w bush thing in season 1 i quote  gt    we were deeply dismayed to see this and find it     unacceptable  disrespectful and in very bad taste     we made this clear to the executive producers of the series who apologized immediately for this inadvertent  careless mistake we are sorry this happened and will have it removed from any future dvd production   a press release made by hbo  apologizing profusely when they learned that the season 1 finale of game of thrones inadvertently included a shot of a prop head of president george w bush impaled on a spike  i just friggin love how exactly two seasons later  after a similar event  major character dies a shocking death one episode prior   they actually threw in a line referencing that controversy 
4787,gameofthrones,wait wait wait seriously  does anyone have a screenshot of the head  would it be on my dvd or has it been edited before release 
4788,gameofthrones,nice catch seems like a pretty major easter egg i m surprised more people had nt noticed already
4789,gameofthrones,maybe he used the castle where sam met bran in season 4  do nt remember the name   it was nt manned and i think they said it has a secret passage where sam let bran and his companions through to the other side of the wall 
4790,gameofthrones, here we sleep  house cthulu confirmed
4791,gameofthrones,acting as civilians may be an interesting story to read leaders of the largest holdfasts will probably have one hell of a story trying to keep peace and order during the long night as reports of northern castles being overrun fly in lots of smallfolk will die first  as they do from winter  those politically savvy will have to leverage their survival goods into safe harbor for the winter margaery has the benefit of geography  get as far south as south goes speculating she escapes kings landing  sansa at winterfell that s the safest stronghold in the north but still so far north a terrible place for the long night while it has natural hotsprings under it to keep it warm even during the long night  you d constantly by under seige from the undead location location location little fingeron the road at the gates of the moon  i bet the eyrie would be safe if you could get some dragonfire up there to keep it from the annual freezing over in winter daenerys should consider it for a dragon roost  get it together dany  he can present himself as useful to some cunninglord who keeps him alive for the winter in exchange for the lands titles wealth that littlefinger can muster through robin but otherwise  he likely stands to be a metaphor for a man so tied in political bs he ignore the big game  or a weaselly cockroach who ll survive by sheer greasiness and continue to posture to be king of the ashes after the war  what your pointing out makes sense  it s a questionable strategy to go with diplomacy during what seems like frozen dark undead armageddon  but the children of the forest won the war for the dawn and drove em back so there s some magic way to survive  the best way to access magic for a muggle in westeros is probably rise high in a big castle or be a maester at the citadel 
4792,gameofthrones,littlefinger has a valyrian steel dagger  the one that was used in the attempt on bran  if i remember correctly at least in the books 
4793,gameofthrones,ollyyyyyyyy 
4794,gameofthrones,was nt george bush s severed head also in the lord of the rings  one of the uruk hai s was modelled off him 
4795,gameofthrones,no ygritte died by the blacksmith s area near where styr was killed jon died in front of the tunnel to go north of the wall 
4796,gameofthrones,the layout of the castle in my mind and how the shots and angles of the scenes portrayed their deaths has me thinking they died on completely opposite sides of the yard  edit  not in a symbolic way  i just mean that i do nt think there was any significance to the place of their deaths because they were nt near eachother 
4797,gameofthrones, yep     <URL>  
4798,gameofthrones,has a calvin and hobbes feel too
4799,gameofthrones,i think it was meant as a symbol for everyone being equal infront of the gods rather than the mere punishment for cersei
4800,gameofthrones,great observation but what s with clickbaity title 
4801,gameofthrones,i guess we had to get the teaser out of the way before we get a true trailer 
4802,gameofthrones,normal fire doesnt kill the white walkers  only dragon fire i would assume  since valyrian steel and obsidian are rumored to have some kind of dragon magic in them  headshots on the whights are just to slow them down  if they are chopped down to pieces  even if they are still alive  they are not a big threat the wights are the  zombies  and the walkers are the blue guys who are a different species  not undead in regards to essos  we do nt have any record saying they have ever appeared there but if they bring winter with them and not the other way around i would assume that they would eventually reach there
4803,gameofthrones,none reaction videos have a very short shelf life  and the internet does nt really care about seeing yet another reaction video to episodes from previous seasons 
4804,gameofthrones,i m not sure regular old fire works on white walkers because they just seem to go out when a white walker is close 
4805,gameofthrones,jon snow said the long night is coming he s definitely gon na resurrect and <URL> azor ahai 
4806,gameofthrones,everyone dies  
4807,gameofthrones,so they have faces of dead and alive people  i do nt understand what they were trying to portray  maybe foreshadowing  since the faces were of basically all the main characters 
4808,gameofthrones,its runny how they did nt show ramsey  which obviously means he s the sole survivor i can imagine the very last scene being him riding drogon while waving a sausage 
4809,gameofthrones,you know who we did nt see  syrio  the comeback is real  
4810,gameofthrones,yeah  there s no way he would have not told jon  had he known nor leave him to that fate and above all they would never risk telling sam because they would know he would go to jon his look of guilt is likely due to feeling like he s leaving the place of importance  and of course knowing he is one of jon s only friends so he would be without any support 
4811,gameofthrones,we know regular fire ca nt kill them because the fires all seemed to be extinguished as they walked through them in hardhome pretty sure it has to do with dragons  dragon  glass  valyrian steel  valyria being home of the dragons   and i m guessing here  dragon fire i think the endgame of the show is going to be a massive showdown between the white walkers and the dragons 
4812,gameofthrones,he has a greater relationship with his mother and her side of the family than his father so he probably resembles the lannister a lot more  think of this way you have a father and mother  you are close with your mother and she always pays you attention you will think of yourself more closely towards her than your father 
4813,gameofthrones,so did anyone else notice the faces next to jon snow s  stannis on the left and ygritte on the right 
4814,gameofthrones,not a foreshadowing  just a warning that no character is safe this season
4815,gameofthrones,  <URL> tell me it ca nt be true 
4816,gameofthrones,ever frickin  wear hats  do nt they know that <SMILE>0  of body heat is lost through your head 
4817,gameofthrones,kit harington is obligated to show his gorgeous locks for the ladies  but qhorin  an experienced ranger  always wear hat and cover his ears he s also not handsome enough to be obligated to show his locks for the ladies all the time 
4818,gameofthrones,is it me or the thread titles are getting more and more buzzfeed style 
4819,gameofthrones,the <SMILE>0  naturally occurring heat loss from the head  fact  is actually a myth  but in the case of the night s watch  chances are they are losing a lot of heat from not wearing hats frozen ears are the worst 
4820,gameofthrones,if we are talking in the show not the book  i think it is because it is much easier to identify main characters when they are not wearing headgear it is quite common in movies for lead actors to eschew standard hats  hoods  helmets  gas masks  etc in situations where they would normally be warranted for sake of easier identification by the audience it is a conscious choice by directors  not usually an oversight 
4821,gameofthrones,jon snow s knowledge is contagious 
4822,gameofthrones,you lose the same amount of body heat from all parts of your body <SMILE>0  does nt just float out of your head 
4823,gameofthrones,many viewers find it difficult enough to remember all the characters in the show if they wore identical plain black hats it would make it even more harder to remember the various actors 
4824,gameofthrones,lol funny you should mention this every time i find myself freezing during winter i think  but nights watch   seriously though some of those guys dont wear much
4825,gameofthrones,maybe the milliner  hat maker  for castle black was in apprenticeship training in old town as the old milliner passed away from old age

4827,gameofthrones,are nt they all kind of destroyed right now  especially in the show  stark  ned dead  his father rodrick too  his sister lyanna too  his brother brandon too  his brother benjen is gone  his wife catelyn is dead  his son robb the king in the north is dead  along with his wife talisa and his child and even his wolf  5 children remain but they re all believed dead except for sansa who is well sansa lannister for the south and sansa bolton for the north  they may get a proper comeback though  it must be season 6 main plot right now  boltons rule  tully  catelyn is dead  her father too  so as far as i know we have edmure as a hostage poor brynden tully will most certainly face a siege by the freys for now  the riverlands are rulled by the freys the boltonsfreys alliance really replaced the starktully one  arryn  well  jon arryn is dead and lysa is dead  so there is robin  a retarded child basically the power of the vale belongs to littlefinger now  baratheon  renly is dead stannis is dead with his family and allies  robert s name is carried by the current king  tommen baratheon who is in fact a lannister incestuous son as more and more people know about the incest  baratheon name is basically gone keep rowing gendry  tyrell  the brother and the sister  queen  are in jail  i think loras will die this season as well as mace and possibly grandma olenna loras  brothers are nt even mentionned in the show id say their credibility is gone same as lannisters  their fight brought them down together  martells  well  they may be in the best position right now  they managed to stay out of the conflict until season 4 so the majority of their power is still there but despite prince doran patience they lately took part in the war too with quentin dead  not even in the show  and aryanne not existing in the show  they may end just like the others  lannister  tywin is dead he was the lannisters  then  what do we have  3 children 1 killed his father  and officialy his nephewking  and is now on the run  the two other are a mad queen who just lost what she had  political power   and un onehanded kingslayer  who ca nt inherit lands nor marry  who by the way fucked the said mad queen and got 3 incestuous bastards the first was mad and is dead  the second was beautiful and is dead  and the third one has the will of a ronflex in a kfc out of chickens  they re being destroyed allong with their tyrell rivals by the high sparrow amp  co   amp  co  including cousin lancel  who ca nt inherit and fucked the queen too poor kevan despite being the last  respectable and capable  lannister has no heir  and will probably die in the show like in the books im having a hard time listing all the reasons this family is fucked still  they re my favorite family and i m sad  and well  house targaryen does not even has lands at this point maybe dany could get along with the martells and take dragonstone and the stormlands but for now they re not part of the seven kingdoms  if i were some throne player  i d ask myself if i d really want to get those 7 shitdoms right now  do you think cousins of cousins and forgotten bastards can carry the greatest names or do you think the  7 kingdoms  will belong to other families 
4828,gameofthrones,stark does nt matter they have plot armor they will win  tullytullys seem tight with the stark  sooo yeah arrynthey are screwed baratheon there s still gendry  edric storm and mya stone tyrell margaery is probably safe  but it is entirely possible that the tarlys decide to take over martellspretty safe lannistermany many lannisters left  are you forgetting greyjoys  gt  and well  house targaryen does not even has lands at this point maybe dany could get along with the martells and take dragonstone and the stormlands but for now they re not part of the seven kingdoms  there is no way the matrells could ger along with dany after quentyn aegon has the stormlands 
4829,gameofthrones,there s also the lannisport lannisters if the main family falls  jamie cersei etc  then the lannisport lannisters will most likely take control of casterly rock starks obviously look fucked now but of course they re the protagonists of the show so they ll be back as for the tully s someone commented saying they ll be alright because they re tight with the starks but idk i could see george fucking them over  its thrones and the good guys do nt always win but the blackfish is a huge badass and could keep them going baratheons are so fucked unless some of the bastards get legitimized the arryns are pretty fucked too
4830,gameofthrones,ok i m gon na try to take this family by family  edit  fyi rickard was ned s father  not rodrick starks  sansa  arya  bran  rickon  jon     and jeyne  robb s wife  is pregnant if i m not mistaken this is the main protaganist family and at the very least i expect sansa  bran  as a tree   and rickon to live through our story so their line can continue  tully  the blackfish and edmure are alive and i expect edmure to live why would the freys kill him when they married him into the family blackfish is childless and unmarried but that can change  arryn  this is the one family i do think is probably gon na get wiped out do nt see sweet robin making it harold hardyng is a decedent of the arryn line and he may yet survive but he does nt have the arryn name  baratheon  we know gendry and edric are both still alive i m sure there are other unknown bastards as well all they need is legitimization and i ll add that stannis is nt book dead  and is like the only death ever not shown on tv show deaths tend to be very graphic as soon as it cut away i was like  damn  brienne decided not to do it   so there s a chance he still lives  tyrells  lot of tyrells left mace has like 4 kids  all of whom are still alive if i m not mistaken i do expect mace to die though mace also had a sister marry into the redwynes there is plenty of opportunity for the tyrells to come out of this with the line intact  martells  arianne and trystane are still alive and oberyn has a ton of sand snakes just takes someone to legitimize one of them and the martells are the one family who allows a woman to rule i think they are probably the safest  even if arianne and trystane die  lannisters  kevan lannister has 3 living children if i m not mistaken lancel  prolly dies   martyn  given back by robb stark   and janei the youngest tywin also had a sister named genna who is currently married into house frey i tend to think at minimum martyn lives  targs  dany will make it to the last book but might not live  jon snow     and faegon targs have a high probability of being wiped out  especially if jon and aegon are nt targs  greyjoys  theon  asha  euron  victarion  and aeron at minimum theon has no cock so forget him the uncles are all childless as far as i know i think asha will survive though may be the first women to rule the iron islands if i made any mistakes please let me know
4831,gameofthrones,with the arryns it s also important to remember the possibility of robin being littlefinger s child if that is the case  then the  true  arryns may already be lost 
4832,gameofthrones,kevan has other sons it s not just lancel 
4833,gameofthrones,i have only one prediction about what is going to happen from adwd at some point  arya will kill cersei and it will be a sweet  sweet thing when it happens  
4834,gameofthrones,i have a theory that there are too many theoretical theories going around  how s that for a theory 
4835,gameofthrones,stannis could still be alive 
4836,gameofthrones,daenerys does own lands  meereen  i think
4837,gameofthrones,i think danny said it best about the  wheel  of all the big 7 houses playing their  game of thrones   she wants to  break the wheel  
4838,gameofthrones,i could and would argue that the seven great houses are still in tact meaning they could be a stronger bond than the realm itself living through this rebellion and that  including ww   not saying this is the end game  as i m sure some will actually see its  line end but just a thought  for the moment at least 
4839,gameofthrones,they ve all killed each other without acknowledging the  real  enemy amassing north of the wall that s why it s called a  game  of thrones 
4840,gameofthrones,this is a reminder that theories still need to be tagged in this thread this post has an  all spoilers  title warning  but no  theory  warning spoilers from the books and show are fine without tags  but    major theory comments need green speculation spoiler tags       <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide   if you are unsure how to tag your comment  the  spoiler guide     <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide  has examples of the markup you can use   i am a bot  and this action was performed automatically please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   <URL>  to  rgameofthrones  if you have any questions or concerns 
4841,gameofthrones,are you serious about rodrick  he s most certainly not ned starks father he is the master of arms in winterfell  though a loyal to the family  no stark blood in him homie 
4842,gameofthrones,what is bred may never  sigh  i got nothing 
4843,gameofthrones,well he is a lannister a lannister and a baratheon still a lannister
4844,gameofthrones,was nt expecting that at all 1
4845,gameofthrones,did he pay the iron price for that child 
4846,gameofthrones,and here i was thinking he fell off a bridge offscreen in season 4 or 5 guess he s not dead on hbo 
4847,gameofthrones,so we have the direwolf of stark  the sunspear of martell and the taj mahal

4849,gameofthrones,never thought of it  possible indeed 
4850,gameofthrones,what s worse  the walk of shame or a life of manipulation  lying  and murder  she brought the faith militant back into power knowing how they operate only madness explains that decision by a person who carried a laundry list of sins of her own she loves her incest kids the same way cat loves hers  every decision she makes is based on family preservation  not logic i suppose that s a good quality but what else has she done that might be considered good  she is certainly more gray than joff  completely black   but her actions and inactions throughout the series have led her down this path did she deserve the punishment  in the world of ice and fire  i say resoundingly yes and it s normal for us as the audience to feel some modicum of heartache for her in her moment of greatest weakness but that does nt begin to make up for what she has done so far 
4851,gameofthrones,yeah he looks like a  baloon  
4852,gameofthrones,no guys he is correct  its sansa who became a faceless man  killed balon  and took his face 
4853,gameofthrones,so what is this one all about  i guess it s reference to the targaryon sigil is there supposed to be three people to rule westoros 
4854,gameofthrones,personally i believe it is a prophecy about the true rulers of westeros stating that there must be 3 rulers  and each one would ride one of the dragons i believe that jon snow and dany are the first 2  assuming rl  j is correct but the third is up for debate in my opinion there are theories that it s tyrion  and that he is actually a targaryen it is also possible that jojens  sister  is actually jon snows twin sister and that she would be the third head or it could even be bran with the  you will never walk again  but you will fly  line  personally i d like it to be tyrion but that s just me 
4855,gameofthrones,there s a prohpecy that says  the dragon must have three heads  people think that this means that azor ahai  the prophesied hero to save the world from the white walkers  will actually be three heroes  rather than one 
4856,gameofthrones,the legend says that the dragon will have 3 heads and hints about the next targaryen emperor many people think it might be podrik because he might be a secret targ and always impress the women it is believed that this is because he is diphalic  meaning that he has 3 heads in total 
4857,gameofthrones,there is a rumor that rhaegar s son aegon is still alive  apparently his body was switched during the sack of king s landing   could he be the third head if that was a truth 
4858,gameofthrones,i believe it s a reference to aegon the conqueror and his sisters
4859,gameofthrones,nah  that s just a quality westerosi chub n  tuck
4860,gameofthrones,hey everyone  so my cousin is actually finally getting into the hbo series and he just got to the end of season 1 and already was flipping out about the ending aside from the red wedding and viper v mountain scene  what other episodes would you <URL> that i should prep him to set up a camera to record his reaction 
4861,gameofthrones,33  walk of punishment   jaime gets his hand cut off  34  now his watch has ended   dany takes astapor like a badass  39  rains of castamere   obviously  42  lion and the rose   purple wedding  joffrey s death 46  the laws of gods and men   tyrion s speech 4<SMILE>  mountain and viper   another obvious one  410  the children   tyrion murders tywin 5<SMILE>  hardhome   jon kills white walker  59  the dance of dragons   shireen s burning 510  mother s mercy   jon snow s death
4862,gameofthrones,hound v breinne
4863,gameofthrones,might as well catch some purple wedding too that might be his only  fuck yeah  reaction and of course  for the watch 
4864,gameofthrones,i hope you re going to post them  we ve been in need of some good reactions 
4865,gameofthrones,59 drogon arrives might be lost a little since your buddy is binge watching  but for a lot of us  we spent years after those little dragons were born  waiting  just waiting for when we d finally get to see one seriously wreck some shit as a big monster 
4866,gameofthrones,none reaction videos have a very short shelf life  and the internet does nt really care about seeing yet another reaction video to episodes from previous seasons 
4867,gameofthrones,i m not talking about who is appointed to rule  nothing that happened in e10 what happens  directly after  daenerys flies off  what do the sons of the harpy do  just walk away  i ca nt imagine they would be easily let go or easily decide to just leave 
4868,gameofthrones,i just assumed they all fled with shitcaked pants because they just saw a huge fire breathing dragon  and the queen mount the dragon little daggers do nt stop that 
4869,gameofthrones,well their target did just fly away on a dragon 
4870,gameofthrones,considering none of that happened  or in that fashion it s damp  d s lack of imagination and story telling expect to see more of the same in s6 considering they no longer have official source material  they have a guideline grrm told them about  to copy from  it can be assume most of them fled  seeing a dragon is not a normal occurrence let alone one breathing fire and killing people 
4871,gameofthrones,the sons of harpy will obviously try to gain control of the other two dragons  if you do nt see this coming you are a moron  i d suspect that once they try to control the dragons several sons of harpy are fried adn they abandon that plan and the two dragons are free to fly and burn 
4872,gameofthrones, another golden rose  how original i eat from plates stamped with roses  i sleep in sheets embroidered with roses  i have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot as if that makes it smell any better roses are boring  dear 
4873,gameofthrones,i have this colouring book the illustrations are beautiful well done on this one 
4874,gameofthrones,this post has a  no spoilers  title warning  which means    all spoilers must be covered by warning tags       <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide   show tags are black book tags are red theory tags are green if you are unsure how to tag your comment  the  spoiler guide     <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide  has examples of the markup you can use   i am a bot  and this action was performed automatically please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   <URL>  to  rgameofthrones  if you have any questions or concerns 
4875,gameofthrones,more please  
4876,gameofthrones,i m pretty certain nobody is going to sit the iron throne dany saw the throne room in ruins in her vision in season 2  and cersei s promised multiple times to burn this or that to ground for her family chekov s wildfire is still under the city in abundant quantity  supposedly 
4877,gameofthrones,how did the deserter  will  in season 1 get to winterfell   i should have   gone back to the wall   and warned them but i saw what i saw i saw the white walkers  if he passed through a manned castle  eastwatch  shadow tower  castle black   he would be questioned why he was alone  howwhy would he answer that without telling the brothers what had happened 
4878,gameofthrones,he could potentially have gone round the wall like osha did 
4879,gameofthrones,i have been wondering this very thing for the past 2 years amp  i ve been too afraid to post it here asking in case i missed something i brought this up to my fiance many times amp  we ca nt seem to make sense of it 
4880,gameofthrones,hey  i was rewatching the first episode yesterday as it aired in my country and i had this exact same question 
4881,gameofthrones,maybe he used the castle where sam met bran in season 4  do nt remember the name   it was nt manned and i think they said it has a secret passage where sam let bran and his companions through to the other side of the wall 
4882,gameofthrones,probably through a castle that is not manned anymore 
4883,gameofthrones,i remeber reading somewhere that we went to the sea and took passage if i rmb if not he couldve just qent around or went to one of the many empty castles as a man of nw he wouldve known which were empty
4884,gameofthrones,another question is  why did the ww let him live 
4885,gameofthrones,in s01e01  benjen and eddard are  discussing will and his desertion at the king s feast     <URL>  v  xrzav1ulyqq   benjen claims to know the guy eddard beheaded  which may support the fact that he saw will after he ran back to the wall  and knew he deserted when he was absent i doubt eddard would have shown benjen the severed head  but i could be wrong in that 
4886,gameofthrones,the wall does nt always tower over its surroundings it s higher in some places and lower in others he must have found a low point  which would make sense  because winterfell is pretty far west of castle black and he could ve run a long way looking for a place to cross  like  presumably  wildlings do all the time with their spoils from raiding 
4887,gameofthrones,secret door at the night fort 
4888,gameofthrones,i wondered this also i know there are some wildlings that raid the northern villagers osha got through somehow but  i do nt think it is said exactly how he got through 
4889,gameofthrones,was he executed north of the wall  hmmmm  
4890,gameofthrones,i figured he snuck away while waiting in prison at castle black 
4891,gameofthrones,there s a whole chunk of land west of shadow tower with no wall and no castle he could ve just walked through the forest 
4892,gameofthrones,confirmed
4893,gameofthrones,let s kill some crows  season 4  gets me hyped

4895,gameofthrones,the kingsroad  the song that plays when jon and ned have one last conversation before they split off to the wall and king s landing  i also loved  this     youtubegwmgrr9a<SMILE>1<SMILE>  t  7m9s  version however  it s not in the official soundtrack full track  here     <URL>  v  rmhbradndhc   the wars to come  when stannis got owned by the boltons loved the music that went with the charge 
4896,gameofthrones,i adore the  unsullied theme     <URL>  v  kiyisuzc6e   or maybe i just love the scenes with this theme in it  either way i could mention a hundred others  stannis  theme  robert s theme  which you obviously never hear any more  but you miss it   that punkrock bear and the maiden fair  creepy arya theme  wildling battle themes  listen for them in the battle at castle black  fucking brilliant   faceless man s little chord  this show has a pretty good soundtrack  i guess  is the sparknotes 
4897,gameofthrones,my personal favorites   forgive me  season 5   oathkeeper  season 4   the night s watch  season 1 
4898,gameofthrones,the wars to come warrior of light forgive me  season 5  any of the blackwater soundtracks what is dead may never die winterfell goodbye brother finale two swords
4899,gameofthrones,i want a full good version of the bear and the maiden fair 
4900,gameofthrones,the bear and the maiden fair specifically the version played at the red wedding when the bedding ceremony begins  but i ca nt find it anywhere  
4901,gameofthrones, source     <URL> 
4902,gameofthrones,gt  ned s head under a headsman s axe  ah you fucked it up 
4903,gameofthrones,this was a lot less terrible than i expected 
4904,gameofthrones, they one they did for season 2     <URL>  v  tr2qahux4na  is genuinely really good 
4905,gameofthrones,i watched this a while ago  but that night s watch oath never gets old  pure epicness 
4906,gameofthrones,that was compelling stuff excellent 
4907,gameofthrones,it makes me wonder  how many of dany s initial batch of freed slaves are still alive 
4908,gameofthrones, i am the dragon s daughter  gives me chills everytime
4909,gameofthrones,lol khaleesi s part is hilarious
4910,gameofthrones,kind of creeped out at times with the sync to the voices reminds me of when you film something at 34 speed and play it back at normal 
4911,gameofthrones,i m amazed at the effort ppl go to to make shit like this i really enjoyed it 
4912,gameofthrones,never fails to amaze me but this thing is like a year old there has been a season 2 version as well which i did nt like tbh
4913,gameofthrones,please let there be a season 5 one with shame shame shame ding ding ding pleaaaaseeee
4914,gameofthrones,very nice 
4915,gameofthrones,i was hoping for something funny  but this was just really gay
4916,gameofthrones,what the fuck
4917,gameofthrones,that was the gayest thing i ve ever seen 
4918,gameofthrones,with today s release of a new teaser for season 6  i thought it might be interesting to take a deeper look into what is actually shown perhaps we could identify a pattern or some

______________________________________________________________________________   identifying key elements    the most noticeable thing in this trailer is that it takes place in the house of black amp  white this is where the faceless men keep their  well  faces presumably only the faces of the dead are kept in this hall  and we do nt know how the faces make their way there it would nt be unreasonable to assume some kind of magic is involved  though this has yet to be confirmed or denied  i think the order in which the faces are shown is fairly significant for a number of reasons let s break it down   stark  stark  tullystark  lannister  lannisterbaratheon  baratheon  snowstark  wildling  starklannisterbolton  lannister  targaryen  lannister  stark  lannister it s easy to see that we have two major players  the starks and the lannisters when the teaser starts out there is a noticeable focus on the stark side as it progresses  things get a little bit muddled up and we start to see more lannisters  with some others interspersed it might be worth noting that sansa is also in some respect a lannister through marriage to tyrion  but then again it was never consummated and she was remarried to ramsay bolton this leads me to question if there are meant to be other connection through daenerys and arya i personally could nt see where arya comes in  but there is the potential for a link between tyrion and daenerys given the theory that tyrion is a secret targaryen it is possible  though unlikely  that this is a link the teaser is trying to hintat  moving forward  one of the most obvious distinctions in the teaser is the dead versus the living the first four shots all show characters that we re pretty much certain are all dead  except for one we then hit jon  who s fate has been debated since the end of the latest book following this  all characters that are currently alive i think it s pretty clear why it was linedup like this  they want to stir the debate about jon s life is he to be lumpedin with the dead before him  or the living after him  or is he some sort of fulcrum between the two  personally  i think that s exactly it currently he is dead  which should nt surprise anyone  but i and many others are convinced that he will return in some capacity that would make him both dead and alive during the season however  this careful placement could also be a red herring  and here s one of the biggest reasons why i think that might be the case  all of the dead characters say something in the teaser they each have a line that s been cut out from one of their scenes before death these  phrases  generally encapsulate the biggest aspects of that character ned s story was one of honor  robb s one of war  catelyn s one about family  joffrey s about control  and jon s about defending the realm the clips were carefully picked as the ones that best represented those characters before they died  and that includes jon so that could be a sort of nail in the coffin for jon  but the particularly insistent like myself might say that they re playing on the technicality that jon is currently dead  even if that may not continue to be the case it might also hint that jon snow is dead  and he will be somebody else when  if  he returns only time will tell for sure  the last obvious detail is that all these faces are in a place where only the dead should reside  so to speak given that we see six definitely living characters  we re clearly being led to wonder if there are implications being made here the faceless men are particularly fond the saying  valar morghulis  or  all men must die  this seems to be the obvious conclusion  all these characters will die  as will everyone else i ve also noticed that jon s line is the only one to span across two of the shots that is to say  we begin to hear him say  the long night is coming   while looking at jon s face  but only when the camera pans to the living characters does he finish with  and the dead come with it  the way this is done is very clearly deliberate  but to what end  talking about the dead just seems to cement the idea that these characters will die  right  but what if it s exactly the opposite  i think they re trying to emphasize that these characters will have significant roles in fighting the dead  and will be the major players that come out of it alive perhaps this is wishful thinking  but it would be terrible storytelling to just end with  and everybody died  i think we re looking at the six  maybe seven with jon   heroes  of the realm  if there s something i missed  please leave it in the comments  i m also interested to see everybody else s speculation on these things 
4919,gameofthrones,why is it presumed only the faces of the dead are kept there  before she went blind arya saw her own face on another person  as for the significance of  the dead come with it   pointing to the those who are still alive and presumed dead come simply imply that those characters will have an impact on the long nightwhich the inevitable winterdespite their mortality many of the characters  actions echo throughout the realm even after they have died  many other characters have died as well  but the ones shown that have died have had arguably the greatest shifts in the direction of events due to their impact while alive and the shifts that occurred due to their absence  and those still alive are the ones still left to leave their mark and should they fall will have the greatest impact from their absence 
4920,gameofthrones,here s how i see the teaser  ned starts with explaining how executions should be passed so we have   1    death by execution  robb goes on to explain how he s won every battle but lost the war so   2    death by war and what that means for everyone  catelyn then speaks about revenge and wanting to show other people what it s like to lose the things they love most so we have   3    death by revenge  why it is important to someone  then we have joffrey saying how he likes to torment and kill for fun because he s the king  the person who should care for his people   so we have   4    death by psychopaths who love it  finally we have jon  probably one of the only people in westeros who knows what s really coming so we have   5    death by an army of undead ice zombies that can wipe out all of westeros  as we see by the faces of tyrion  dany  sansa  jaime  cersei   basically  jon s statement acts as a nullification to the previous 4 statements they do nt matter because once the army of the dead marches  all those silly reasons like executions  wars  revenge and torment wo nt mean shit 
4921,gameofthrones,frankly  i m tired of being teased  and this teaser in particular  told us even less than the ones posted to twitter a few weeks back i doubt any of the faces have any significance other than to summarize the big moments throughout the series ned stark s face was there  and we know for a fact  it rotted off his skull atop a spike in king s landing there s no way the faceless men have a copy they need the body to produce one it s why they wash all the sacrifices and drag them off to that chamber 
4922,gameofthrones,ultimately i d say that there is no big secret meaning in this trailer remember all men must die so eventually the fm will have these faces regardless of our story i guess if you want to call it foreshadowing or something you can  but i would nt and i d say that all of the people in shot 6 will be dead by the end of book seven  rickon and bran are omitted 1 to carry the stark name  1 to be a tree 
4923,gameofthrones,thats a lot of typing to say very little the idea that jon snow s statement is used to introduce those that will fight the dead is very wishful thinking it s nice to hold on to hope watching this series unfold  but let s be reasonable with it if this trailer is saying anything at all  it is definitely not hopeful i still think there is a slight chance for a happy ending  but i do nt think this teaser is the place to find that i also believe that there is a much greater chance for this series to end in a very tragic manner 
4924,gameofthrones,they have to get back to the island 
4925,gameofthrones,i think hbo liked our idea uertacaltinoz   <URL>  q  gallery  3aertacaltinoz  2f27<SMILE>2966amp  qo  6
4926,gameofthrones,all men must die  pal 
4927,gameofthrones,the way they edited jon snow s part makes it seem like a warning as though jon snow is now part of the threat to the living 
4928,gameofthrones,for some reason i thought that was davos next to joff 
4929,gameofthrones,if you remember the end of season 5 arya pulled all those masks off and revealed her own face which leads me to believe a face does nt need to be dead to be on the wall  no idea what this means  but just an observation 
4930,gameofthrones,maybe jon coming back is just a faceless man 
4931,gameofthrones,the faceless men use faces from the people who die in the house of black and white 
4932,gameofthrones,i was kinda surprised not to get the privilege of hearing charles dance speak once more  is there significance to a lack of tywin 
4933,gameofthrones,are you sure that that is stannis  pretty weird that he died with a beard  and he s shaven in the hall of faces 
4934,gameofthrones,all of the quotes are about death 
4935,gameofthrones,can anyone make out what the whispers are saying 
4936,gameofthrones,it s common knowledge by this point that jon snow will be coming backthough whether it s as his reborn self or something else  is unknown  personally  i think you re just overanalyzing a rather mediocre teaser trailer that told us absolutely nothing the main thing i m with you on is that the major theme was the living vs the dead as the starks amp  redemption are going to be a big part of s6  this teaser is likely to remind us of the dead charactersto weave in that plot of redemption and remind us that there will be some kind of retribution for the lannisters amp  boltons 
4937,gameofthrones,here s a thought  they appear in the order in which they died 
4938,gameofthrones,i m not sure if anyone s mentioned this  but where are the stark boys in all this 
4939,gameofthrones,gt  that is to say  we begin to hear him say  the long night is coming   while looking at jon s face  but only when the camera pans to the living characters does he finish with  and the dead come with it  double meaning of the phrase it s not just that the dead are rising to fight the living  but also that when the long night comes  many who live will die at its hands 
4940,gameofthrones,i m pretty sure the face next to joffrey s is davos 
4941,gameofthrones,i d just like to say that the death of stannis was confirmed alongside the death of myrcella op put stannis  death as debateable

4943,gameofthrones,sheeples overthinking things too much  it s just a trailer 
4944,gameofthrones,gt  the black gate is made of weirwood with a face on it the face is old  pale  shrunken  and wrinkled with white eyes the door glows  when someone approaches the black gate  the eyes open then the door asks   who are you   a man of the night s watch must repeat a part of his vow   i am the watcher  realms of men  the door will open then  saying   then pass  is nt that proof that magic clearly exists in westeros  why many smart characters do not believe in magic  other than dragons   tywin straight out denied the possibility of magic at work when renly got assassinated tyrion was nt much of a believer either or at the minimum  they believe magic is long gone but there s still a talking door   and tyrion has been to the wall  i doubt this talking door is being kept as a secret by the night s watch 
4945,gameofthrones,no one knows about the black gate except sam  and brands group coldhands is the one who showed sam where it was  so the night s watch probably has no idea it s there  people believe that there is no magic anymore because the dragons died out  at that point in time  anything magical is a legend or story  except dragons  dragons were real  and not just stories from the east  but when the last one died people thought that magic had died with it  there are people who think that the return of magic is what enabled daenerys to hatch her dragons  or that her dragons hatching was a sign of magic returning 
4946,gameofthrones,the night s watch does nt know about the black gate as it is kept hidden in a secret passage underneath a fort that has nt been used by them for centuries 
4947,gameofthrones,the nightfort has nt been manned for centuries so it does nt seem like people know anymore  sam had to read about it in a book and it s not like the rest of the watch is in there reading with him at best the talking door none of them have seen is just another magic rumor 
4948,gameofthrones,tyrion traveled to castle black  the door is at the nightfort and sam only knows about it because of the ancient cold hands in the book and because he read am ancient book in the show  not to mention there is more common magic such as prophets  wargs  greenseers and the warlocks of qarth  everyone knows and admits that there was magic in the last  but the concensus is that it has faded from the world 
4949,gameofthrones,night s watch  dark brotherhood confirmed   o
4950,gameofthrones,you forget that we see the entire story  where characters only see it from their own view 
4951,gameofthrones,i want to believe
4952,gameofthrones,this gate is at the night fortlong since abandoned and a fair distance from any of the 3 remaining active castles on the wall  sam discovers it because coldhands takes him there to seek out bran 
4953,gameofthrones,this is a reminder that theories still need to be tagged in this thread this post has an  all spoilers  title warning  but no  theory  warning spoilers from the books and show are fine without tags  but    major theory comments need green speculation spoiler tags       <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide   if you are unsure how to tag your comment  the  spoiler guide     <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide  has examples of the markup you can use   i am a bot  and this action was performed automatically please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   <URL>  to  rgameofthrones  if you have any questions or concerns 
4954,gameofthrones,so im rewatching season 5  watching hardhome again  and i ca nt help but wonder what exactly are the zombie rules here  it is said that white walkers can only killed by dragon glass  and then we learn that valerian steel can too i believe both have to do with being forged by fire  i assume that valerian steel has some firerelated component that regular steel does nt   forgive my ignorance  but i assume that regular ol fire works too  given the fact that they burn bodies to prevent them from coming back  what about all those running skeletons  i noticed people aiming for headshots and it seemed that lopping off heads was stopping them but then when they were throwing themselves off the cliff  they picked themselves right back up and kept at it or did they go at it as long as their head was in tact  so what are the rules in killing them all  what determines who is a walker and who is a skeleton  also does reanimation only occur when it s winter on westeros  hence  when it s so cold in winterfell  the dead get reanimated  and the further south the cold goes the reanimation follows  also what about essos  no winter  no zombies 
4955,gameofthrones,i m not sure regular old fire works on white walkers because they just seem to go out when a white walker is close 
4956,gameofthrones,there could be a certain amount of fuck it just slow them down  going into the headshots in the books  when mormont sends thorne south to king s landing with the dead wight s hand in a jar  he mentions this in the show too   the hand is still alive  and moving for most of thorne s journey by the time he gets to king s landing it s just a dead hand  but when he left castle black  it was solid proof that magic was back in play  anyway what that means  as far as the rules go  is that the brain is nt really in play it s likely some sort of rangebased magic  you never see big hordes of undead moving without white walkers nearby the only way to stop the wights is to stop the walkers 
4957,gameofthrones,white walkers  also known as others  are a different species  while wights are magically reanimated bodies  white walkers have been shown to be intelligent  have their own culture and history while the wights are like the walkers in the walking dead  there are stories of white walkers in asshai by the shadow  so maybe they re not confined to westeros  i do nt think normal fire can kill the white walkers  but it works on wights  valyrian steel is said to be set with magic spells  so maybe the magic component makes it able to kill the others  i do nt think the reasons why valyrian steel and obsidian are their weaknesses are described yet  the others are said to sleep during summer  and wake up during winter  some say they bring the winter with them  either way  they re connected to the cold  if the flesh holding together a wight s skeleton completely <URL>  the wight will die  individual limbs  though  continue moving when detached from the bodies if the flesh is intact  i usually think of them as normal zombies  slow and clumsy and can function even when injured  but the others control them 
4958,gameofthrones,it s likely that the first wights were cushioning the fall for the ones that fell on them  which would mean less damage for them the fact is  the white walkers have wights to spare  and they seem perfectly happy with sacrificing a few if it means they can get more  it seems that while headshots can work  you have to completely destroy the head  and even then  we ve seen that the limps can remain active  plus  you have to remember  these wights do seem to degrade  so the skeletons are just older  while the fresher wights are more human looking and it seems like for the resurrection to work  the white walkers must be close by we saw the night s king do it with very little effort 
4959,gameofthrones,if i am correct  white walkers  also called others  are alive  cursed sons of craster and probably other little kids that they could found in the north zombies and skeletons are called wights  are dead people that were reanimated by white walkers  i think that they can be reanimated as many times as white walkers want  as long as their bodies are not burned  altough if they are dismembered they are nt realy able to do much essos  no white walkers  no zombies
4960,gameofthrones,essos is further south than the north in westeros and as such there is no white walker activity there now  that we know of   however  during the long night  essos was attacked by white walkers also azor ahai fought them back in essos 
4961,gameofthrones,the hardest part vs white walkers is how to reduce casualties on yourside while inflecting casulaties on their side for white walkers every wright death is not a loss  only their commanders count your side  every person s death <URL> a number on white walker s army  if you happen to lose a few heros  say the hound   they retain their fighting style and now they are like robert strong this makes the battle very difficult 
4962,gameofthrones,well with necromancer zombie rules  it seems likely it costs some magical effort to animate the dead  so a walker might abandon a zombie if it s too damaged to be immediately useful especially if there s a thousand others  one zombie  though  in a fight  it would make sense to keep running  even as it s being hacked to bits 
4963,gameofthrones,dragon glass and valyrian steel are both produced using dragon fire it s not just any ol fire that will kill the walkers 
4964,gameofthrones,the white walkers have been trapped north for centuries so essos is most likely safe from them the white walkers were originally found in the north centuries ago and when they were beaten back out of westeros  they just ended up back in the north 
4965,gameofthrones,the rule is  if you have plot armor  your weapons cause harm to those you point them at 
4966,gameofthrones,you know people resurrected by fire magic are also zombies call the ice zombies wights fire did nt seem to work against that other that jon fought  on the contrary  the only thing that can kill a wight is fire  others can make wights in the summer  since it is summer at the start of asoiaf techincally
4967,gameofthrones,fire only kills wights  ice zombies  and obsidian only kills the others  white walkers   i m not sure where valyrian steel fits in with wights  i m guessing it kills them 
4968,gameofthrones,normal fire doesnt kill the white walkers  only dragon fire i would assume  since valyrian steel and obsidian are rumored to have some kind of dragon magic in them  headshots on the whights are just to slow them down  if they are chopped down to pieces  even if they are still alive  they are not a big threat the wights are the  zombies  and the walkers are the blue guys who are a different species  not undead in regards to essos  we do nt have any record saying they have ever appeared there but if they bring winter with them and not the other way around i would assume that they would eventually reach there
4969,gameofthrones,how come the white walker that jon was fighting just disintegrated instantly when jon was killed it  and when sam shanked the white walker it didnt die instantly   pushes nerd glasses up 
4970,gameofthrones,we know regular fire ca nt kill them because the fires all seemed to be extinguished as they walked through them in hardhome pretty sure it has to do with dragons  dragon  glass  valyrian steel  valyria being home of the dragons   and i m guessing here  dragon fire i think the endgame of the show is going to be a massive showdown between the white walkers and the dragons 
4971,gameofthrones,white walkersothers are definitely vulnerable to valyrian steel and obsidian in hardhome their natural cold seemed to diminish the effects of nearby fire but i suspect that a lot of projectile fire would do the trick people burn the dead bodies to prevent them returning as wights  which are the zombie like creatures that are killed only by fire or severe dismemberment
4972,gameofthrones,not many rules understood it was discovered by sam that dragon glass kills ww  and dragon class is a result of volcanoes  another name for it obsidian jon was the only who discovered that valerian steel works too  it s knowledge is lost as well but everyone s got an itch that fire or dragons or volcanoes are involved  grrm says he relates valerian steel to damascus steel in real life and that it s knowledge was lost as well among other similarities  minus the magic offcourse  as for wights  aka your zombies  p they are stopped via chopping them into pieces or by fire the ww in hardhome that jon fought extinguished the fire before entering into the big tent  so i doubt fire works on them and i think it was mentioned in many sources it does nt work  except dragon s fire  that should work on both ww and wights as for the headshots  well  i guess they are just missing their headseyes so they are slowed as we saw in bran s battle with the wights  they do nt die or stop completely if you chop off their arms or heads  the two methods are burning or chopping them into many bits  slow them down enough they are nt a threat i guess 
4973,gameofthrones,dragon glass and valerian steel are probably the same thing  at least it s been speculated for a long time that they are and there s enough evidence to assume for now that they are  i do nt think headshots have ever been shown to kill them  just fire and dragon glassvalerian steel there s a theory that valerian steel is forged with dragon fire i think the wildlings aiming for headshots are just doing so out of desperation there s too many for them to actually win so they re just lashing out with what they have available that said  we ve never seen a headless white walker which suggests they ca nt be reanimated it s likely that the magic the others use is similar to those of the red priests and if you remember  when arya asked if they could reanimate someone without a head  poor baby t  t   thoros responsed that they could nt we do nt really know enough to draw a conclusion really i m inclined to believe that if the headsskulls are nt completely destroyed the wights could continue to fight hence why the dead in the north and beyond the wall are burnt and not simply beheaded but i think if they were to just be beheaded then they would nt come back  side note  does anyone else hope that when the others inevitably make it down to winterfell  we ll see white walker brandon  lyanna and rickard    as far as does reanimation only occur during winter  it s the ww who reanimate people  apart from the red priests but that s for another conversation   and it s always winter when they appear  although it s not clear if they create winter and bring it with them or if winter spreads and they follow if it s the former  i d assume that if they were not stopped before reaching dorne  then yes they could also spread to esso  the summer isles and sothoryos 
4974,gameofthrones,valerian steel is only created with dragon fire it can be reforged without it but not created the name dragon glass  should also give it away it s not just ordinary obsidian this extra touch of magic is what kills the whites 
4975,gameofthrones,it s tv  it s hbo  there are no rules
4976,gameofthrones,hey there  sry for mi bed englis   after watching the teaser i am a bit bored  i forgot what exactly the faces on the wall meant  is every face displayed  or only people who did x or are going to die  are dead  i dont know anymore  what criteria does a face have to be on the wall 
4977,gameofthrones,i have nt read the books and only watched through the series once and i finished months ago so my details are shaky but it s like this  the faceless men who occupy that building can take the formidentity of those people remember the faceless man  jaqen hghar     <URL>   he was nt actually that person but killed that person and took his identity so faceless men  which arya is trying to <URL>  can use those identities on the wall  the last shot has all the main characters who are alive so far and that s just for effect as i understand  they ca nt actually use those identities in the story 
4978,gameofthrones,the faces are of people named by the many face god or ones that commit suicide in the house of black and white i assume people who worship the many faced god  pray for and tell their god of atrocities people commit  then the god somehow communicates with the faceless men and names someone if someone is not named  their face can not be used  remember what jaquen says to arya in the show about her killing someone not named   if you do nt remember  he tells her she stole a face from the many faced god stolen as if it can not be used
4979,gameofthrones,wellvalar morghulis 
4980,gameofthrones,if you pay more attention you ll notice that many of the main characters fight without helmet they have done this so that the main characters are more recognisable even though they should ware something on their head

4992,gameofthrones,you have no idea how much i was about to facepalm about your post til i clicked the link  gg  a man has been fooled 
4993,gameofthrones,i loved jamie and brienne  it s a love  but one from respect and understanding and i dig what they did for each others characters 
4994,gameofthrones,the walk of shamedo you think it was the right punishment  i m thinking her hair will grow back and anything that walk broke in her is going to bounce back stronger i think years of banishment would have been more effective on her curious to see what others think 
4995,gameofthrones,it was probably a bad idea for those religious pussies she s going to get her revenge and i ca nt wait 
4996,gameofthrones,not sure where damp  d are going to go with her character but in the book  she starts all confident and this is nothing  attitude and by the end she is completely broken she realizes that she could only dream of being queen again now that everyone has seen her like that and her focus seems to have shifted entirely on protecting tommen but of course  it could be all acting from her part but yeah  as far as punishments go  it s in typical church fashion to diminish women like that  i doubt this  walk of atonement  is performed by men 
4997,gameofthrones,a big slice of humble pie will do one of two things to an ego we shall see which result we get 
4998,gameofthrones,her walk of shame was just part of her punishment  she is still going to face a trial for her other crimes if she s found guilty  she ll be sentenced then  the walk was her punishment for the adultery she confessed to 
4999,gameofthrones,i hate corrupt people in government  cersei   but i hate religious zealots even more  high sparrow   so i think i might want to see cersei get revenge 
5000,himym,the writers knew how to use music got ta give that to them 
5001,himym,it  s pretty good  but maybe not even the best teaser in that episode when marshall says  i  m never drinking again   and then it flashes forward to the night he gets wasted in atlantic city which ends up being the season finale 
5002,himym,the whole episode has the riff of victoria  by the kinks in  starting with ted showing off at the news stand  right the way through the barneynorah stuff  leading to the reveal of ted bumping into victoria at the end  i bloody love how they hint at stuff on this show  and this was one of the best examples 
5003,himym,this is a really nice gif
5004,himym,i totally get what you mean i see the barney grin 
5005,himym,you  re not missing much  sometimes i think i  d rather have stopped after season <SMILE> and left it a mystery 
5006,himym,me too thanks
5007,himym,which episode is this from 
5008,himym,i am simply creating a discussion thread for those who have binged the entire final season  i watched it live  thought it was ok  and then binged the season one lazy sunday i enjoyed it so much more after this way i encourage you all to give this a shot  particularly if you did nt like the finale 
5009,himym,it s much better but also leads to incredible mood swings  especially from james 
5010,himym,it s especially funny when you remember the apartment is smaller than what s shown in the show because it s bigger in his memories 
5011,himym,but netflix does have all 9 seasons 
5012,himym,i ll paraphrase what i said in a similar discussion not too long ago about this  i was nt able to completely watch s9 when it aired  due to my workschool schedule the finale aired at the start of my spring break  so i spent all of the preceding weekend binge watching the first 22 episodes in preparation for it when i finally saw the reviews the season had gotten so far  i was a bit confused because i did nt mind it so much watching the episodes nearly backtoback keeps it from dragging on too much  and it was easy to get through the filler episodes  that said  i still feel like they would ve been better off making it a condensed season of 13 or so episodes  and letting the finale air with its original planned length 
5013,himym,def the way to go imo it makes the season make a lot more sense  in a time scale  which i found made it a really enjoyable experience  although i never watched it live in the first place  
5014,himym,i watched season 9 live and did nt really enjoy it i m currently binging now and i m still not feeling it  i feel like himym ran for two seasons too long i love seasons 17  the first half of season <SMILE> is okay  the second half of season <SMILE> was a chore to get through  and season 9 is making me lose interest in the show altogether it seems like the showrunners ran out of ideas and phoned in the last two seasons 
5015,himym,the last season definitely holds up a lot better after having two years between viewings as josh radnor said  the show will age well i m glad to report that has happened for me  at least  slapsgiving 3  slappointment in slapmarra was still the worst episode of any show ever though 
5016,himym, and that kids is the true story of how i met your mother  in the episode where it ended with him talking to a stripper
5017,himym,kids  your uncle barney grew up without a dad and it always made him feel <URL> but as he hugged loretta  surrounded by the boxed up remnants of his happy childhood  he realised he had one hell of a mom  chills and tears every time 
5018,himym,everyone else has said my favorites when it comes to inspirational so i ll say the ones that made me laugh the most   to cindy   hey  look me i promise i m not going to fall in love with your roommate  f ted  oops  ted  yeah  like i m never going to tell my future kids about the time that uncle barney banged 7 girls in 1 week  f ted  am i a bad dad 
5019,himym, you have to take action  and you will  albeit more for the parts of the longer quote i ca nt remember 
5020,himym,i watched the whole series again and it just makes a lot more sense in my opinion i loooove it would ve loved a little less wedding and a little more tracy and ted  but it was still awesome 
5021,himym,something that i really loved about this show is how future ted can sometimes say some things that are incredibly real and that s what i wanted to ask all of you  one of my favorites is   you would be shocked kids  when you discover how easy it is in life to part ways with people forever that s why  when you find someone you want to keep around  you do something about it  s  9e  21 so  what are some of your favorites  future ted s  quotes 
5022,himym, you may think your only choices are to swallow your anger or throw it in someone  s face  but there  s a third option  you can just let it go  and only when you do that is it really gone and you can move forward 
5023,himym,i feel  tickticktick  s7ep10   no pressure  s7ep 17 and the finale should ve been on the list other than that it was a pretty good list 
5024,himym,i m disappointed that there was nt even a mention of bad news  but the show had so many great episodes that is hard to choose only 10 
5025,himym,currently watching season 9 again the first time around i felt distracted watching it because i was just anticipating the finale this time i can pay a lot more attention although  i still find the drag out of the two days a little tedious 
5026,himym, kids  am i bad father  
5027,himym,that fucker s smirk though 
5028,himym,the line that packed a punch not one that necessarily ruined the show  but just one which made you reconsider everything in your life   and i carried it with me when she got sick   ted  9x24   i m not ready for this    marshall  6x13   sometimes i wish i was nt a mom sometimes i wan na pack a bag and leave in the middle of the night and not come back   lily  <SMILE>x13   nothing good happens after 2am    ted  1x1<SMILE>  just a few of my favourites
5029,himym,season 7  episode 17  after robin came back from russia and told ted that she did nt love him back   marshall  um hey  listen  ted told me what happened with you guys  and he says that he s at peace with it  robin  oh  really  that s good  marshall  he s lying  robin he s trying to be strong  but it s killing him  and so  as his best friend  i have to say something that he loves you just way too much to say   you got ta move out   robin  i know  it still kills me 
5030,himym, should nt we hold out for the person who does nt just tolerate our little quirks  but actually kinda likes them    double date   05x02
5031,himym,ted  okay  i m going to say something out loud that i ve been doing a pretty good job of not saying out loud lately what you and tony have  what i thought for a second you and i had  what i know that marshall and lily have  i want that i do i keep waiting for it to happen i m waiting for it to happen i guess i m just tired of waiting and that is all i m going to say on that subject 
5032,himym,for its effect on the character   i m not ready for this  i noticed the countdown the first time watching  so i was really anticipating whatever it was we were counting down to then lily delivers that gut punch that no robot  no wrestler  could withstand my heart broke for and with marshall  for its effect on me   you will be shocked  kids  when you discover how easy it is in life to part ways with people forever  it s true at least it s been true in my life and i had nt realized it the show was actually making me realize it  that many of the people who had been with me during that part of my life  when i was the characters  age and having similar experiences  were out of my life except for actual breakups  there had nt ever been any  we re done  moment   we just drifted apart   that s actually also true for one of the breakups i heard 2nd hand that she was pissed at me for something  i got pissed that she did nt talk to me about it herself  i thought  well  screw it  until she wants to talk to me  i ll just continue to ignore her  it s been 16  i think this was in 2000  right  you guys remember  years  i ve moved twice  including from pa to mn   and have since gotten married i think i can consider that chapter closed but we never officially broke up i could see this being a ted story line  tbh the girl just shows up after 16 years  under the impression that they re still together  and had just been having a silent fight 
5033,himym, because if you were going to be some lame suburban dad  why could nt you have been that for me    6x19  the moment you realize that barney s character is more than just comic relief  
5034,himym,my absolute favorite scene is when klaus talks with ted at the farhampton station  s0<SMILE>e01   there is a word in german  lebenslangerschicksalsschatz  and the closest translation would be  lifelong treasure of destiny  gt   lebenslangerschicksalsschatz is not something that develops over time it  s something that happens instantaneously it causes swirling like the water of a river after a storm  filling you and emptying you all at once you feel it throughout your body  in your hands  in your heart  in your stomach  in your skin have you ever felt this way about someone  if you have to think about it  you have not felt it everyone does eventually  you just never know when or where 
5035,himym,robin   you stole a blue french horn for me  ted   i would have stolen you a whole orchestra   2x22   this moment i can and have listened to on repeat for hours on end it was so honest and emotional  here was a relationship we were invested in since the pilot to see it all come to an end  victoria   i really hope you get her someday   <SMILE>x5   i loved victoria and she always knew what ted could never admit robin would always be a major part   salute   of his life 
5036,himym,  andiamo  fratello non mastroianni tutti i funions  
5037,himym, what kind of mother would nt be there for her daughter s wedding  
5038,himym,after the finale  i rewatched and caught the hidden significance behind <SMILE>x20 gt  hi  i  m ted mosby  and exactly 45 days from now  you and i are gon na meet  and we  re gon na fall in love  and we  re gon na get married  and we  re gon na to have two kids  and we  re gon na love them and each other so much all that is 45 days away but i  m here now  i guess  because i want those extra 45 days with you i want each one of them if i can  t have them  i  ll take the 45 seconds before your boyfriend shows up and punches me in the face  because i love you i  m always going to love you  til the end of my days and beyond you  ll see 
5039,himym,paraphrasing  but when barney told his mom that she s all the father he would ever need in  cleaning house  it was just so amazing
5040,himym, kids  you know what i would have done first   <SMILE>x20 
5041,himym,i was rewatching himym and at the end of season 1  episode 22  lead anchor sandy rivers is holding a blue umbrella with one yellow strip this was after ted made it rain  which was supposed to symbolize his destiny with robin 
5042,himym,reddit post  everybody drink 
5043,himym,and for those who ca nt let s hope the tivo gods are in a good mood today  but if they re not i want to help  i have a sledgehammer
5044,himym,hahaha that was my first thought today as well streaming it here in australia  while at work  shhh   so no one to watch it with 
5045,himym,every time i watch this episode all i can think about are those wings and dipping sauce 
5046,himym,interesting how barney s gambling addiction was started by marshall
5047,himym,this is special we need to do this every year promise me 
5048,himym,that s because she lived it  ulomats7 that s because she lived the how ted met their mother 
5049,himym,not unusual in the business  many actors avoid watching themselves 
5050,himym,she took a buzzfeed quiz asking which season the episode was from based on lily s hair and went 09  source     <URL> 
5051,himym,what a grinch 
5052,himym,the best i can give you is mine  that keeps the ending but makes it flow a lot better if you want the one that you re describing  you re going to have to wait for a few more weeks until i finish my new edited finale    <URL>
5053,himym,gary blauman  i hate that guy 
5054,himym,in the episode where ted is visited by future copies of himself and barney to try to talk him into robots v wrestlers  what s the point of this episode  i ve seen it at least 10 times and all i gather from it is that it s unnecessarily sad for no reason 
5055,himym,has anyone tried the naked man  or has been on the receiving end of it  if so  did it work  supposedly 2 out of 3 timeslol
5056,himym,dave harmon did it successfully on karen phillips in  a loving mother  back in the late 60searly 70s  which i only know bc i was raiding my dad s paperback stash 
5057,himym,what is the story behind this music  do you know who the composer and arranger was  it sounds a bit like a  hey  beautiful  arrangement but i m just not sure 
5058,himym,this is nice  did you make this  or is it from an episode 
5059,himym,to be fair swarley slapped marshall three times  while marshal had only slapped swarely once  so if we say  every time one of them slaps the other prematurely they get two additional slaps  then after swarely slapped marshal 3 times that s 6 slaps  plus the one for winning the bet  so 7  this presents lily with a rounding issue  because who wants to give out 7 slaps  10 right away or 5 across slapternity seems about equal  and 7 is in the middle 5 and 10  roughly  so it seems fair
5060,himym,did nt barney have to agree to lily s being named sbc  once all parties agree on the sbc  all rulings <URL>  fair  he had every reason to expect that she would favor marshall over him  and to know that he was nt exactly her favorite person  tho  of course  this is the same guy who insists that he is ted s best friend  so 
5061,himym,i do nt know when it first aired but it played a few times in the show i m on how your mother met me and the mother is talking to dead max and the song is playing  just wanted to know if there is a full recording of that melody or if it s just that piece 
5062,himym,i have a copy of it i used it in my fan made ending i ll upload it when possible 
5063,himym, here you go     <URL>  v  khioxdpn_9o   it first aired in  the time travelers  and the song is named  you  re all alone  after the line from the episode when we realise no one else is at the bar and it  s all ted  s imagination 
5064,himym,  <URL>
5065,himym,this is really cutting it close as to what counts as relevant to this sub 
5066,himym,i ve tried it on my wife i m 1 for 1 so far i imagine the 2 out of 3 guarantee will hold up though 
5067,himym,it s not the entire score  not even close lol   but  john swihart s soundcloud     <URL>  has 20something tracks hopefully one day  he can release a lot more anything in particular you were looking for 
5068,himym,plays vanessa in deadpool and is crazy hot and crazy 
5069,himym,crazy eyes 
5070,himym,dude we should buy a bar 
5071,himym,i drink out of the green maclaren s pint glasses but i m australian so it s ok  
5072,himym,as we know  the only backup mother was going to be victoria she and ted met at a wedding  just like tracy and ted did obviously c and c had this plan of  one love story ending as another one begins   but i do nt know
5073,himym,to my understanding  stella was also an option preseason 4 if the show did nt get renewed 
5074,himym,so i sought out season 9 and realised that netflix had actually been doing me a favour all along 
5075,himym,yeah much better then when i watched it live also i m catching stuff i did nt notice s9e19 if you do nt know the giant hints in the episode already go watch it and do nt read anymore  3 times they give hints that she s about to die it s so sad catching it now i ca nt believe i missed it but at the same time i was only half watching it 
5076,himym,i was rewatching the slap bet episode and i noticed something that really bugged me when marshall slapped barney prematurely and was wrong barney got two slaps on marshall but then when barney did the same thing to marshall lily made him choose between ten slaps immediately or five at any time  thats absurdly biased by lily and not at all fair the slap bet commissioner is supposed to be impartial 
5077,himym,it s not a bad point  but to be fair it s pretty well established that they re absolutely perfect for each other in a way that no other girl that ted ever dated really was 
5078,himym,i dont think it shows up before season 9  where they then abuse the shit out of it i seriously hate that little melody  himym got me well conditioned to expect great sadness immediately following it sorry i do nt have a link  i just really hate that piano line 
5079,himym,where can i buy  
5080,himym,from revenge of the slap
5081,himym,dude it hit me during the sex scene that she was crazy eyes freaked me out from there on
5082,himym,i bought this mug for my husband  along with the clear pint glass i have a tshirt for myself bonus  our last name is maclaren 
5083,himym, you may think your only choices are to swallow your anger or throw it in someone  s face  but there  s a third option  you can just let it go  and only when you do that is it really gone and you can move forward 
5084,himym,i was hoping it was a mosbius designs mug 
5085,himym,i did enjoy it more this way as well season 9 gets such a bad rep
5086,himym,something the writers went to great lengths to establish was the gang s warmth towards tracy  especially lily one can only assume this was to show that unlike many of ted s other trainwreck partners  tracy was sound and the meddling would have been minimal 
5087,himym,do you think ted s friends killed her 
5088,himym,here s a few    you ca nt cling to the past cause no matter how tightly you hold on  it s already gone    life is a dark road  you never really know what s up ahead one night you re cruising along  enjoying the ride then all of a sudden    you can ask the universe for signs all you want but ultimately we only see what we want to see  when we re ready to see it    sometimes you realize the journey you ve been taking has reached it s final stop so the question <URL>  where do you go next     there s more than one story of how i met your mother there s a bigger story the story of how i became who i had to <URL> before i could meet her and that story begins here 
5089,himym,when it does come out just watch every episode except the finale  much more satisfying 
5090,himym,rewatching everything again and up to season 7 there was an episode where they showed marshal and lily having bets about their friends  lives  they had a bet about robin and ted never being together  and they had many chances to pay up and they never could  at the end marshal said  not yet  
5091,himym,  one day you ll step outside  and your life will change forever  
5092,himym,i do nt know if they specifically had a name for the person  but they always referred to them as being  on lt  insert persongt  s hook 
5093,himym,i think marshall pays lily when tracy takes a picture of the gang before ted and tracy s wedding but unfortunately  marshall had won the bet so i guess post finale  lily should have paid him back 
5094,himym,definitely i did nt like the season when i was watching it as it aired  but enjoyed it so much more while rerunning the entire series even the finale seemed enjoyable and i did nt hate it  might have even liked it  especially since i was a ted and robin rooter   if you felt disappointed by the last season and the finale  you should definitely revisit it and binge it 
5095,himym,yes he did  lily paid him the money in the deleted scene
5096,himym,yeah  it was after that episode that i knew definitively that they would end up together  and i started theorizing that the mother would likely die
5097,himym,yeah me too i just finished a rewatch of the entire series i always thought that 13 were phenomenal  4 great  5 okay and 79 horrible this time up until season 6 it was a good show  seasons 7 and <SMILE> had some really cringey moments  but most of the last season  even the rhyming episode i hated the first time around was good comedy 
5098,himym,i request the highest of dabs
5099,himym,then why does it say super bowl 46 on that guys hat 
5100,himym,yup sometimes people are hookees and sometimes they re hookers 
5101,himym, it was like something from an old movie  where the sailor sees the girl across the crowded dance floor and turns to his buddy  and says  see that girl  i m gon na marry her someday   to me  those words rang out like the clarion call of destiny   un coup de foudre    an inviolable prophecy  if only in the figurative sense 
5102,himym,is that key in front of him 
5103,himym,i want to gripe about something else in season <SMILE>  i m almost done with a rewatch  while we are on the subject of complaining the whole  kennedy package  think with lily where linus has to make sure she always has a drink makes no sense in the context of her being pregnant are we really to believe that lily s logic was  i want to take the edge off but i ca nt drink so i m willing to pay  100 to make sure that i always have a non alcoholic drink in my hand   apparently stress makes her really dehydrated i know it s nit picky  but it feels like lazy writing like they really wanted the joke of lily always having a drink  so they did nt care that it made absolutely no sense 
5104,himym,i really wish it would have showed somthing about how barney s daughter ended up or at least had a scene with the mother of his kid
5105,himym,the show is called how i met your mother a season after they met would have been against the whole point what the show really needed was about 20 minutes of ted grieving let her death sink in  and then bring back robin that would have solved all the issues 
5106,himym,the way they treated barney s character in the finale was probably the worst part for me they spent the whole show building up his arch and having him slowly stop being interested in the wild sleeping around ways but then they just dropped all of that instantly and had him go on a fuck spree  the finale pretty much abandoned all the character archs they had set up earlier 
5107,himym,in all fairness the show is titled how i  met  your mother  not how i dated your mother i assume that the kids already know things about their mother s life and how their early relationship went  if not how they met he even says that they know the short version of the story it was  supposed  to end when they meet 
5108,himym,i actually did nt mind how much the mother was in the show i think it was rather tastefully done the show was still how i met your mother  because meeting robin is what technically made barney and robin s relationship possible this in turn led to meeting the mother  that being said  i found the final three episodes a train wreck of highs and lows especially the ending 
5109,himym,one of us   
5110,himym,rando i love it 
5111,himym,sounds like you ve got a keeper 
5112,himym,does she know about the  official alternate ending      <URL>  v  rohus<SMILE>j7x94 
5113,himym,maybe the mother was right for him at the time  like barney s short successful  marriage that ended maybe forever is too long to expect anything to last that another theme is that perfect moments  albeit short  are all we can really expect 
5114,himym,as soon as the final episode ended  i cracked up i made a realization that  it s a <URL>  do nt get me wrong  since there was such a huge buildup about the mother  her appearance on the show was way less than i expected  i thought it was a great show  despite this i really enjoyed emotionally connecting to the characters  and it s really interesting how events in ted s life  seemingly unrelated to the eventual meeting of his wife  actually did relate  the fact that the show ended made me realize that  despite having an emotional connection to the characters and their story  it s over they are nt real  i   however   do  have a future  it was nice that this show was not so much  happy ever after  culturally  in the us  at least if you re brought up watching disney  etc   there s this idea of  happy every after  once you meet your spouse but that s unrealistic this show was so great because it showed how complex relationships are it s not just romanticsexual relationships  but how they relate to each other and how your friends and family fit in there s not necessarily  one   perfect  person out there or maybe we can say there is  but things do nt always work out the way you initially expect  and the fact that he gets back with robin is fitting  in my mind   they have all those great stories and memories together  and they get along  really well  as  friends  when and if i get married  i want my spouse to be my best friend  that s my two cents 
5115,himym,ted and robin on the roofthere is no off switch
5116,himym,what the heck  cindy and the beautiful girl 
5117,himym,ted and tm s first kiss 
5118,himym,well she has done a couple of great things over the last 15 years firefly  v  homeland  gotham not really a new face around here 
5119,himym, spoilers  i would have hated having victoria end up as the mother even with the way it ended with the mother dying  victoria would have made me even more disappointing with the show 
5120,himym,yesh 
5121,himym,ted and robin in season 1 finale after he made it rain for her
5122,himym,the kiss and the  thank god   moment when ted finds victoria in season 1 
5123,himym,that episode in general was really cute always good on rewatch even though it s high on the schmaltz
5124,himym,i was catching an old episode of himym and it was the wedding episode back from season 1  ted and victoria vow not to kiss or hook up at the wedding but teddy westside decides to look for buttercup up and down the city  at the end of the episode he founds her and they have their first kiss  it was an amazing moment and no disrespect to the couples that followed but this was the perfect first kiss and this shows best  what do you think is the shows best kiss 
5125,himym,yup  i miss 2014 
5126,himym,okay  so i m 100  sure i m  obviously  not the only one who s noticed this  but i thought i d share something funny i noticed  season 9 episode 12   the rehearsal dinner  the gang is sitting at the bar  cracking jokes about what weddings would be like in canada after a few cracks  robin states   two mitten jokes in a rowso you re pretty much done now  to which ted narrates   kids  we were nt even close  now  watch the background when the jokes continue to emphasize just how long their jokes go on  there s a whole story that unfolds for a family behind them it s the same people in the background throughout the little scene  just a funny thing i noticed  did anyone else catch it 
5127,himym,fertility clinic barney respects women and builds families barney wants to stop sleeping around  but he ca nt because he s insecure and does nt think he can hold a relationship 
5128,himym,for what it s worth  i had always thought one thing about tracy should have been a dopplegaenger of her own  to ensure her place in the selfstyled awesome group  since that did nt happen  i ll set up a reason in terms of this thread  tracy had no need of a dopplegaenger because she was fully comfortable with how she expressed herself 
5129,himym,gt  who his friends adore because he does nt go on long rants and he fights robots  though to be fair  it s mostly the robots thing by itself 
5130,himym,tweet this to the creators  
5131,himym,robin still is masculine
5132,himym,this is a great observation and makes me appreciate the show even more i m betting that this post will show up on yahoo news in the next couple of days 
5133,himym,  glass shatters  
5134,himym,wow  this is amazing 
5135,himym,but what about that chick in the group of chicks that looks like marshall 
5136,himym,holy fuck dude  nice catch 
5137,himym,here is what the linked meme says in case it is blocked at your schoolwork or is unavailable for any reason      himym finale fail roll    gt     post title      how the himym writers came up with that finale  gt     top      ted s met the mother what do you do now   gt     bottom      end the show with the happy ending everyone wants    original link  1     <URL>    meme template  2     <URL> 
5138,himym,mine is probably either the beaver song  p s i love you or nothing suits me like a suit 
5139,himym,cristin milioti s version of la vie en rose man that song haunts me  i also sing sandcastle s in the sand on a daily basis so there s that  
5140,himym,let s go to the mall without a doubt  sandcastles in the sand is my runner up  robin sparkles was amazing 
5141,himym,boyz ii men  you just got slapped
5142,himym,gt  actually  there is a word for that it  s love i  m in love with her  okay  if you  re looking for the word that means caring about someone beyond all rationality and wanting them to have everything they want no matter how much it destroys you  it  s love and when you love someone you just  you  you don  t stop  ever even when people roll their eyes  and call you crazy even then especially then you just  you don  t give up because if i could just give up  if i could just  you know  take the whole world  s advice and  and move on and find someone else  that wouldn  t be love that would be  that would be some other disposable thing that is not worth fighting for but i  that is not what this is  it did nt made me reconsider everything in my life though 
5143,himym, i would have stolen you a whole orchestra 
5144,himym,that line of lily s nearly brings me to tears every time maybe it s just good acting on her part  but it looks like she genuinely knows how that feels she really gets across the crushing weight of having those feelings because if we re being honest here  what parent has nt felt like that  parenthood is fucking difficult sometimes  and you kind of lose a lot of your identity in it for awhile  no contribution unfortunately  but that was a big one for me as well 
5145,himym,the most devastating part for me did nt even have a line it was in season 7 episode 10 when barney broke up with nora to be with robin but when she got to maclaren s she was still with kevin i ve been in a similar situation and ted is right that second feels like it never ends 
5146,himym, love is the best thing we do  that line from ted sums up the entire story so well  9x23 
5147,himym, i m not ready for this    marshall  6x13  times 1000
5148,himym, you will be shocked kids  when you discover how easy it is in life to part ways with people forever   9x21  gary blauman  this one from ted is one of the sad truths of life  from the show pov  it was the moment i realized that it was ending and there would nt be a new season
5149,himym, look around you ted  you re all alone  this made me realise that everyone has their own problem to deal with and the best you can do it just suck it up and deal with it yourself not everyone is gon na be there for you when you need someone  
5150,himym,i ca nt remember the specifics and ca nt look it up right now  maybe someone can help me out  but the line about anger about how you can keep inside  or throw it back  or the third option  and just let it go 
5151,himym,not a line  but when robin shakes her head at barney in  tick  tick  tick   s7 e10  in that moment  for the first time in the show  i saw barney as vulnerable this was a character who risked big  but always managed to come out fine  but here  he risked it all for the love of another and he got nothing 
5152,himym,barney after he and robin broke up and he started going after chicks again and lily asks him if he s changed at all he says something along the lines of  if it was nt gon na happen with robin  it s not gon na happen with anyone i m never gon na be the guy who sees a girl and immediately is like you are the love of my life  everything i have and everything i am is yours forever  i m the guy who straightens his tie  says something dirty  high fives himself  and goes and talks to that girl this is me guys  ca nt i please just be me  
5153,himym,as soon as the the divorce happens everyone would know exactly how it will end so there would nt be any impact
5154,himym,i actually liked the format of it all being the wedding  because it made the finale more surprising and unpredictable and almost served as an epilogue showing the next 1<SMILE> years however  i would keep barney and robin together and not have tracy die there are some scenes i would add in  2 weeks after the wedding  ted and robin  now both in love with other people  share their last cigarette ever on the central park carousel and finally get over each other  subsequently failing to put the cigarette out properly and literally burning the symbol of their second thoughts for each other to the ground it also coincides with both the dates ted mentioned in  last cigarette ever   as robin  s is in june 2013 and ted  s is 2 weeks into dating tracy finally  it explains why they put up the no smoking on the carousel sign in  disaster averted   also  tell us how robin became a bull fighter goddamnit 
5155,himym,just finished the series last night the death just happens so fast i felt cheated wish they d given her at least a season of just being with the gang before pulling that stunt  and i did nt like the format of constantly jumping back and forth in time during barney s wedding 
5156,himym,my ideal season 9 would ve been the finale  just stretched over 24 episodes  i think it should have been flashbacks to the wedding over the 17 years that the finale covered then the divorce would ve been a good mid season finale  and we would have been able to enjoy some of the better moments of the finale and probably had better closure with tm s death 
5157,himym,that would nt have made any sense with the concept of the show  its the story of how ted   met   tm the kids already know about the life they lived as a family they were there  the few days leading up to the moment they met is the key  and focusing so much on that weekend  the near misses  and finally the meeting at the train station makes more sense for the concept of ted telling the story 
5158,himym,goddamn reading through this is so freaking powerful  thanks for making this thread for me it was when barney is talking to his daughter  you are the love of my life  everything i am and everything i have is yours forever  this scene is so strong
5159,himym, a kid needs a hoop 
5160,himym,i agree with op   sometimes i wish i was nt a mom  by lily really brought out some emotions in me  i m not a mom   we all knew that she loved marshall and marvin so so much  and how much she wanted to be a parent  it just shows that we all have our weak moments i guess 
5161,himym, i m not ready for this  when marshall hears the news about his dad dying    unbelievable delivery by jason it really got to me
5162,himym,barney   you are the love of my life  everything i have and everything i am is yours forever   s09e2324   the delivery on that was incredible everything that was explored through barney s character over 9 seasons came out in that one line 
5163,himym,february 2nd at 1  0<SMILE>am central my daughter was born into this world unfortunately since the mother and i are nt on good terms at all i was nt allowed to attend here i am two days later and i finally got to meet my daughter facetoface and just as barney suspected he would act in season 9 episode 24  i thought i would nt feel different at all and that i would be a cold soul about it all  practically disregarding the fact that i even had a daughter  the second i laid my eyes on her i took hold of her and the only thing i could manage to tell her was  you are the love of my life everything i have and everything i am is yours forever   himym foreshadowed how i would react to meeting my daughter down to the teary hug i had with her after i told her 
5164,himym,congrats  let us know if you need a shotgun or help beating up some dudes in 13 years 
5165,himym,i remember those feelings 
5166,himym,wow  got a little attention  i figured it would seep through the cracks thanks everyone for your kind words of sincerity  
5167,himym,no matter what kind of relationship you have with her mother  be a freaking awesome dad for her
5168,himym,congratulations 
5169,himym,congrats  you re going to love that girl so much 
5170,himym,congratulations  i hope everything works out amicably with the mother 
5171,himym,mazel tov 
5172,himym,it bothers me how many of these rules i know despite only pursuing one woman in my lifetime i have no idea how i ve learned these things 
5173,himym,gt  and it s my oldest rule  therefore the best 
5174,himym,i am unable to access other websites since it is blocked by our administrato other than vidtome appreciated your help thanks
5175,himym,what s better than the hot girl i m seeing  her okay looking roommate i have nt slept with yet 
5176,himym,i saw that someone put season 9 of himym into a movie  so i decided to reedit a more satisfying conclusion to the show  using footage from episodes 22  23 and 24 to try and make a  good finale     uloztonetxxt7krtchimymfinaleavi   hope you all enjoy  just open the link and you should be able to download it if there are any questions i d be happy to answer  and thanks to thegimboid for the idea 
5177,himym,it s in hd  so it s a pretty big file  i ll upload a lower quality version later edit   here s one   kinda   still hd file     <URL>  202mp4  dl  0   this one s about 1gb standard definition version  here     <URL>  20sdmp4  dl  0  edit edit  since the dropbox files are having some issues  i made a torrent file   link     <URL>  usp  sharing  i m also going to see if there s another way for me to upload it as well    edit edit edit  if someone still wants to see it  send me a pm and i ll hook you up  
5178,himym,just finished watching great job on this the pacing felt like it had momentum
5179,himym,i ca nt get it on mobile 
5180,himym,great job  i have to praise how you handled the episode s transitions and the pacing in general i know there was a lot to cut out  but you managed to keep it pretty coherent  now for a bit of criticism  which may be very subjective so take it with a grain of salt  1 you said that daphne is hard to cut out  which i agree  but i think there were a couple of unnecessary scenes on the final cut  like the ones with clint and daphne s daughter  which makes her appear for half the film i know that it s there to teach marshall to stand up for himself  but i feel like he already learned that lesson when he decided to take the job without telling lily  2 after all that build up of marshall and lily s arc  it s kind of disappointing that it resolves so fast  or maybe i just really like the discussion marshall has with ghost lily  the one about keeping score   3 very minor things  when jeanette drops the locket there s a brief scene of young ted losing his balloon which does nt make much sense without context or when barney says that vengeance will soon be his and it s never explained what s he is talking about  his job   but this one i understand that you ca nt cut him midsentence  4 i m sad that the short scene where  barney finally passes the torch     <URL>  v  gdckmrns  did nt make it or gary blauman s last scene  5 given how you decided to end the story  the official alternate ending narration would have worked much better imo  6 i almost forgot  you showed how everyone met tracy  except barney i feel like you should have squeezed that somewhere 
5181,himym,remindme  7 days
5182,himym,i am not able to access the file  any way i could watch it 
5183,himym,yes    <URL>  v  rohus<SMILE>j7x94
5184,himym,he has a long arm  
5185,himym,sweet nice 
5186,himym,be sure to cross post this to rfanedits 
5187,himym,really enjoyed watching this  and a much more satisfying ending compared to the original in my opinion great job thanks
5188,himym,i really enjoyed it did you ever consider just using the exit from the  alternate ending     youtuberohus<SMILE>j7x94  t  3m21s   but this was a lot of fun 
5189,himym,thanks  i ve been meaning to do a rewatch  but do nt want to deal with season 9 again  
5190,himym,broncos win sorry barney everyone drink 
5191,himym,i did nt know what either of their real names were until today  but abby elliott  jeanette  is the daughter of chris elliott  mickey aldrin   this continues how often himym used outside relationships to incorporate characters like sandy rivers  scooter  and gary blauman  found in this jimmy kimmel skit featuring abby elliott   youtubetamesxtbn_<SMILE>  t  5m25s
5192,himym,this is my favorite episode it s just meant to make you sad and realize how ted s life is the only one not going anywhere and it s a lot more poignant once you see the ending of the series 
5193,himym,hello  i was wondering if the score for himym was ever released  not the soundtrack  but the score  all of the original instrumental music that was written for the show   i ca nt seem to find it anywhere  but i figured i d ask thanks 
5194,himym,does anyone think that part of the reason tracy and ted worked out was because for the first year  lily and marshall were in italy and barney and robin were traveling andor simply not around  i know it was supposed to be because she was so good for him etc but i ca nt stop thinking about how the friends would have somehow caused a problem 
5195,himym,best kiss is lilly and marshal at the airport when he brings the marching band
5196,himym,yes  if you watch the table read for the last episode on youtube  at the end marshal is singing a song and lily has to pay up for some reason they did nt show that in the show 
5197,himym,what if marshall poisoned tracy so that ted could be open to fall in love again in a few years in order to win his bet with lily  
5198,himym,thank you so much  to me  this music is an outward  ascending spiral of joy  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  does anybody know how to transform a youtube post into an  mp3  file i would like to use this music on my alarm clock  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  as i have stated before  this music would make a really cool wedding recessional 
5199,himym,cougars  barney does nt normally go over 30 as far as i can remember 
5200,himym,i ve been watching the show for the first time and i already know all about the finale of the show and the ending i do nt want that ending  is there a fan edit of the final episode with less divorce  fewer deaths  and no robin  ted 
5201,himym,i feel like people who do nt want to watch the original ending are just in denial 
5202,himym,super cool  thanks 
5203,himym,you should put this on rfantheories
5204,himym,thats actually a really good point while marshall never interfered with teds love life lily certainly had a hand in some break ups over the series  and with robin no longer an option at all along with barney out of his womanizing ways ted had the ability to nurture a relationship while not constantly around heavily codependant and meddling people nice fan theory 
5205,himym,   lesbian robin   is the masculine version of robin that her father desired a part of robin likely wishes she could have remained masculine     mustache marshall   is not only a lawyer but grows a sick mustache that marshall can never grow and for 2002 marshall who is nt even in law school yet  this is very desirable     stripper lily   represents the part of lily who wants to embrace her slutty side and not have to worry about being a mom or being responsible and instead just cuts loose     mexican wrestler ted   is this macho cool version of ted who his friends adore because he does nt go on long rants and he fights robots     fertility specialist barney   gets to look at women s vagina s all day 
5206,himym,timing    <URL>
5207,himym,i think it s pretty well established that part of why they worked was because robin was off the marketout of the picture for a long time but the part about the others never occurred to me great point  op 
5208,himym,what episode is the one where they are talking about how close marshall is to his family that he never misses sunday dinner  and you see them ask marshall if he would like to say grace and he s on skype  is there a clip of this 
5209,himym,on the hook 
5210,himym,awesome thank you 
5211,himym,marshall pays lily during the alternate ending
5212,himym,is the movie any good 
5213,himym,spotify
5214,himym,there was a fan edit a while back that was absolutely perfect same <URL>  but you walk away feeling a bit more comfortable with it  since the way it was cut really shows that ted and tracy had an amazing life together for a pretty long time  keep in mind the kids are in their teens and she s been gone for about 6 years   and that she would have wanted him to move on once that sting is out you really get to see the artistic vision behind the show it speaks a lot about fatedestiny  and a big part of the theme was always how what might be right for you at one point in your life  might not be right for you later on or viceversa  the shirt    in his 30 s40 s tracy was what he needed someone to start a family with and at that same time barney was what robin needed  someone to keep her company while she lived out her dream career but later on in life ted already having the kids  and them being mostly grown up  and robin being  well  robin they were what they needed then even his kids encourage him to go get her  but i m rambling  my point is  the video seems to have disappeared but i ll bet if you look hard enough you can find it it s much better and i m sure your gf would love it   ps  if you ca nt find it  i think i have it downloaded on my old computer let me know and if i can find it  i ll upload it to dropbox or something 
5215,himym, you re
5216,himym,the last season was embarrassingly bad 
5217,himym,so cab driver barney was nt a real doppelganger  but question on that front  when did barney learn to drive  there was a whole episode on how he could nt drive and how terrified he was trying to learn 
5218,himym,marshal <URL> a state supreme court judge  lily <URL> an art consultant in italy  ted designs a high ride building in new york  robin <URL> a star news anchor  barney just gets rich doing basically nothing 
5219,himym,watch parks and rec i love that show  but the ridiculous success of every single person that worked in the parks department in fucking pawnee  indiana makes me feel infuriatingly inadequate 
5220,himym,so did i watch the show  yes i did 
5221,himym,in a way  it s easier to write people ho who do nt have to worry much about such material things 
5222,himym,describe them 
5223,himym,do nt forget robin was a teenage popstar 
5224,himym,it s almost like its a tv show 
5225,himym,pulling them off 
5226,himym,to be honest  it was dumb for barney to even agree for lily to be the sbc  there s no way she was going to be impartial however  lily should have done a better job and this is on my list of reasons why i dislike lily 
5227,himym,sorry  but no not the original ones 
5228,himym,what brought me the most comfort was a pic saying  for 9 years we dreamed of true loveonly to have our happy ending ripped away from us so soon after we got it   ted  standing in the rain  just like this guy  that s paraphrased  but maybe the sentiment will help her as well
5229,himym,just when i thought i knew all the quirks of the show 
5230,himym,i like this  but it makes a lot of scenes from the show meaningless  and also cuts out a lot of great scenes the ending we got was the ending we were always supposed to get  and i think it fits the show perfectly sure it could have been executed better  like giving barney and robin s marriage more time on the show  but otherwise i think it worked out great 
5231,himym,you might have ruined the show for me i m not sure yet 
5232,himym,s1e3 sweet taste of liberty holy bagpipes the laugh track ruins that episode they go off about every 5 seconds throughout the whole episode  and it s a pretty funny episode i think they improve it later on in the show
5233,himym,goddamn you op
5234,himym,yewhew
5235,himym,fuck you op
5236,himym,i prefer the emotional roller coaster of the original ending this is too fairly tale 
5237,himym,that s a great observation
5238,himym,i just finished my first run and stopped before the two part finale i ve heard this before and felt that the show was perfect as of episode 22 of the last season i have no regrets about not watching the finale but i do regret some asshole explaining the ending to me when i posted about it 
5239,himym,try binge watching it it is totally different 
5240,himym,something i need to get off my chest is that bob saget narrates the whole time and then in the last episode it s just  old  ted talking to the kids  what was the point  idk why it bothers me but it does 
5241,himym,can we just give himym finale bashing its own subreddit yet  or is that already what this subreddit has <URL> 
5242,himym,yess  i think i picked up on this but had forgotten to actually think about it deeper also uender<SMILE>9 is amazingly spot on  ugh i love this show just got done watching it over for the second time  but to be fair i started when most of the seasons had nt come out yet so it was a lot of waiting  i wan na watch it again now  
5243,himym,unless ted and robin broke up a few weeks after the finale 
5244,himym,yes this has been caught hundreds and hundreds of times it literally gets posted here at least once a week 
5245,himym,never thought about it like this  incredible observation 
5246,himym,in another world when lilly did nt date marshall or he died early on i m betting she s a major slut like a female barney who i m sure she slept with a few times maybe even robin probably ted  wow think for a second how much that would change the show
5247,himym,  <URL>  v  e2gnjwj0vm0
5248,himym,i was looking for a sign for doing something legendary tonight because of desperation day you my friend gave me the green light
5249,himym,in season 7 episode 4  1 of barney s plays is that he is a gay hairdresser picking up chicks for his straight brother  so during that scene  we have a gay guy playing a straight guy pretending to be a gay guy to pick up chicks for said straight guy  i ve had some vodka tonight  by the way 
5250,himym,do nt you mean he s an alive guy pretending to be an alive guy pretending to be a dead guy  it s nph pretending to be barney pretending to be dead barney
5251,himym,it s a sign  bro
5252,himym,seriously one of the best episodes 
5253,himym,for me  the best part of the episode is when marshall is like   lily does nt know i m high  and lily s like   you re high   that face she makes with the voice she uses  hysterical 
5254,himym,which episode is this 
5255,himym,most of those are observations rather than rules  of course but hey 
5256,himym, new is always better  is barney s oldest one rule so that makes it the best  
5257,himym,the platinum rule
5258,himym,what can she say  mama gets swag  it was really lazy writing to further the plot of just one episode in the episode with her sister  s2e12  she says that she has never said  i love you  to a boyfriend because she has never been in a relationship for more than 6    months but then 4 episodes later apparently she has gotten 5 dogs from exes the plot hole with barney and driving was also season 2  in e17 he ca nt drive  in e1<SMILE> he steals ted s truck   i wouldnt been totally surprised if carter and craig were just trolling us 
5259,himym,what s makes no sense to me is that she has 5 dogs in a tiny new york apartment  that s bordering on animal cruelty besides that she works crazy hours  lives alone and spends all here spare time at ted and marshall s apartment or in the bar how does she take care of 5 dogs   how does she pay for 5 dogs   when is she walking these 5 dogs   why ca nt she just have one dog  why not 5 guinea pigs  it s so crazy  and makes absolutely no sense 
5260,himym,i assumed the first bf pulled a  classic schmosby  and gave her a dog a couple months into the relationship to show he is serious but in turn ended the relationship because robin ca nt commit the other 4 bfs did nt want to be outdone by the previous so they gave her a dog even earlier than the other ones  robin did nt tell ted this until he asked because she finally learned that if she did ted would get her something super crazy considering he already dropped the i love you bomb on their first night  stole a blue french horn  asked her out with a blue string quartet  and made it rain for her before they even went out 
5261,himym,ted s telling the story and he s an unreliable narrator  
5262,himym,yeah it was stupid unless she brought some of the dogs from canada 
5263,himym,much like valentine s day itself  desperation day dates back thousands of years weddings were forbidden under ancient roman law  so st valentine performed them in secret  under threat of death 
5264,himym,this episode is so accurate
5265,himym,her name better be wait for it
5266,himym,probably one of my top 5 favorite episodes 
5267,himym,herein lies a potential minor spoiler yeah  i know  people hate  this actor is in this movie  too  it s like discovering robin in charge of helicarrier anywaycobie smulders is in the movie results basically  she s a physical trainer that apparently runs a lot while talking to a client  the words came out of her mouth  spoiler   s  but  um   not only did i lol and scare the crap out of my cat  but i also had this strange compulsion to take a shot  
5268,himym,i loved the timing of this interchange
5269,himym,so the definitive how i met your mother episode  haha
5270,himym,i ca nt open this dropbox file too much traffic on your account could you post it somewhere else 
5271,himym,she also got at least another five dogs after that because the dogs in the finale are not the same as before
5272,himym,after seeing that popular internet meme of the study of violet  i began to think about all of the other colors introduced throughout the show and eventually came to see color symbolism as projections of character development and perceptions  at the beginning of right place  right time  ted says   the great moments in life wo nt necessarily be the things you do they ll also be great things that happen to you  so i began to see it as when the characters are associated with colors of the darker nature  purple  blue  green  these are symbolic of the characters pursuing something or attempting to make something happen while the other half of the wheel red  orange  yellow are symbolic of the things that happen to them  i ve made associations by the direct opposite colors as well  blue amp  orange purple amp  yellow green amp  red each color represents a theme of a type of desire or need that is fulfilled or unfulfilled the colors worn or associated with represent what that particular person represents to them each color is introduced as the following  blue french horn  the item that ted steals on his first date with robin to woo her purple giraffe  the toy robin reports during her news show that a little boy traps himself in a grabaprize machine to retrieve green suit that barney wears to a saint patrick s outing and convinces ted to join him by claiming there will be  no tomorrow  orange kangaroo  ted attempts to get stella a fake diamond ring from a grabaprize machine but gets a orange kangaroo to give to her instead red cowboy boots  a spontaneous purchase ted makes for himself but is disparaged by his friends for wearing yellow umbrella  item passed between ted and mother until they actually meet there s an episode where barney talks about  misdirection   which has been the theme throughout the entire series the way that a story starts has an unexpected ending given these events  i began to notice that each color represents types of expectations and how consequences correlate with types of wantsneeds blue  the pursuit for something wanted  ted wearing blue hues when deciding to betray zoey and declare arcadian as not a landmark  robin is wearing blue when she finds the box for the locket in central park empty  purple  the pursuit for something wanted without realizing the consequences   from the color theory meme  ted telling robin he loves her without realizing impact it will have on friendship robin initiating purple valentines  as a strike against valentine s day but having friends eventually find dates and introducing nora to barney nora wearing purple when about to introduce barney to her parents but not realizing he would break up with her green   no tomorrow   doing something wanted regardless of consequences ted wearing a green dress to challengesupport barney robin wearing a green dress to the night on the boat with barney  nora  and kevin orange   getting what you can get   ted at punchy s wedding  the wedding decorated in orange to represent needing to feel like he too was changing along with his peers from ohio even though they had other expectations and he had his building to brag about red   tomorrow   the loss of something to gain something needed robin wearing a red coat when realizing and reflecting over her infertility robin wearing a red dress when leaving ted in the limo to meet barney  who proposed on gnb tower robin wearing red when about to discuss divorce with barney in argentina yellow  something needed  an opportunity presented ted seeing the mother s little yellow bus when dating cindy nora wearing yellow when meeting barney thoughts 
5273,himym,also if you re watch the ending to last forever  there is a red giraffe behind one of the photos of the mother before they show her in the hospital 
5274,himym,is nt that hauntingly beautiful 
5275,himym,did nt have time to watch the whole thing  just watched the end to make sure it did nt suck thank you for this  this is what i ll tell people to watch from now on instead of the full season 9 shitshow 
5276,himym,no subtitle file 
5277,himym,still does nt explain the pineapple 
5278,himym,after the experience i can only assume a person would have starring in those movies  how can i blame her 
5279,himym,she also said her career was nearly ruined by star wars why would she want to relive that 
5280,himym,delivery improves the lines a lot  how about a vidya 
5281,himym,i really enjoyed watching this thanks 
5282,himym,good point false alarm needed to open in chrome using bacon reader at the moment
5283,himym,but we re gon na kill the mom because it s  realistic  even though nothing else is  this fucking show i still have trouble watching it after that finale 
5284,himym,i m posting late but i want to say thanks i found the finale retroactively ruined the show for me but my boyfriend is forcing me to watch it through once more  even season 9 he s willing to skip s9 if we watch this instead  and we re both happy that you changed the ending  so thankyou 
5285,himym,this used to be my favorite show it was my background noise whenever i did nt have anything to watch  or do  i would put how i met your mother on and just let it play i loved the show  i loved the characters  i loved everything about it i can not count how many times i ve watched it through until the finale i m not arguing a side of how it should have ended it just left a bitter taste in my mouth i ve never had something like that happen before i have nt been able to bring myself to watch it since it ended because i just could nt believe how it all ended up and again  i m not arguing one way or the other  but the originally ending tarnished such a great feeling in my memory and it may be stupid to some  but some of you may understand on a personal level this ending just feels right  and i do nt think i would be bitter about it i do nt care that he ended up with robin i just feel cheated to have been given such an amazing perfect character to only have it all taken away in such a quick impersonal way and i guess that may be the point life cheats you  life does nt care how you ve invested yourself it goes on whether you like it or not but seeing this  for the first time btw  gave me those feelings i used to have for the show again maybe i can start over again and like it the way i used to wow i ve been ranting sorry about that 
5286,himym,does anybody know what that is called  in the past i ve tried to describe it by going  hueah heahheh 
5287,himym,perfect 
5288,himym,it s kind of like this you know it as soon as you hear it while watching other movies   youtubecdbysoeasio
5289,himym,i distinctly remember this laugh being on drake and josh too
5290,himym,why would she  the prequels made directors think for years that she was a shitty actress 
5291,himym,am i the only one who knew about this before seeing this video 
5292,himym,success and economic levels tend to be very distorted on tv 
5293,himym,when people say barney does nt work   pssh  please
5294,himym,every so often i will look at some actor or actresses imdb page seeing what they were in and i will stumble upon the one or few episodes of himym they were on  i immeadiately remember how terrible the finale was and how it completely ruined my love of the show i ca nt even watch old episodes anymore  i am so happy i never bought any seasons on dvd 
5295,himym,i have never heard of the lebanese girl one but damn it i have experienced it 
5296,himym,damn i miss that show  
5297,himym,dear sub  you make sad 
5298,himym, wah wah wah i did nt like the creator s conclusion of their work so i m gon na whine about it on the internet for years afterwards  
5299,himym,i somehow managed to get through this whole series without ever realizing it had a laugh track until this moment 
5300,himym,this same laugh track is also on many later episodes of friends drove me nuts thankfully friends used it a lot less than himym 
5301,himym,file missing edit  false alarm bacon reader fail 
5302,himym,do nt forget first season where marshall is in grad school and ted is a peon in an architecture film  yet they can still afford a big apartment in nyc 
5303,himym,i just noticed  when marshall is first watching the you can call me beercules video at about 6m15s there are thumbnail videos in the right corner for the later videodo you think its on purpose or a mistake 
5304,himym,imho the laugh track has always been the worst part of the show 
5305,himym,this still does nt make me happy i feel sad when i think about how robin is barley part of the group anymore  i need this fixed and then i will be okay 
5306,himym,i do nt know if it was intended at all but i like it  there are some pretty solid examples in there and the show certainly has a lot of very deep meaning to it i would nt surprise me at all if it were true 
5307,himym, glass shattering sound 
5308,himym,but the real question is  is it white and gold or blue and black 
5309,himym,it s actually weekend at barneys if i m correct 
5310,himym,huh definitely a strange connection i do nt think they re purposefully done that way but who knows  hey  when you think about it in harold and kumar  nph is a gay man playing a straight man pretending to be a gay man so he can pick up chicks nph is the only man with more game than barney stinson  edit  went to put in a comma  fucked up the whole thing some how too high  way too late think i m going to sleep now  edit2  inb4 username checks out
5311,himym,how come that robin that never had a long relationship got five dogs from different boyfriends  did they gave her the dogs on the third date  who does that  also  five times  i think that past the third one it gets weird that a new boyfriend would want to give her another i know that it is just an excuse to get rid of the dogs because josh s allergies but i m rewatching the series and this is bothering me so much
5312,himym,this ending is so much better the original ending was just a slap in the face <SMILE> years of building up a character for nothing we already moved pass robin and ted they are nt for each other why force it  then the kids getting all perky and hyper right after their dad was talking about their dead mother  does nt fit the show at all title is  how i met your mother  not aunt whoever decided to use the original ending failed at their job makes me happy  how i met your dad  is nt going to happen hell they even screwed up the title on that one 
5313,himym,week after i finished s<SMILE> just watched the final season in 2 nights  talk about mind blown
5314,himym,  ha ha ha      heee    hee    heee
5315,himym,next time i watch himym all the way through  i m skipping the last 10 minutes of the finale and watching this
5316,himym,that part of the laugh track has always annoyed the hell out of me i never told my wife about it to avoid  glass breaking sound  but this video broke the glass luckily we ve seen the series a billion times already so we ll survive 
5317,himym,way better than the blue french horn ending i m all for the yellow umbrella
5318,himym,i have nt and will never watch the finale this show ends on the wedding day for me 
5319,himym,why could nt we just have this    
5320,himym,holy fuck  what have you done
5321,himym,i could ve gone my whole life without knowing about this and been perfectly fine 
5322,himym,the laugh track was the only thing i did nt like about the showuntil i watched the finale
5323,himym,i m working on a similar project  but keeping the episode format  removing daphne  and some other annoyances hopefully i ll have a few episodes available soon  op  shoot me a message i have nt seen your movie yet  but i d love to talk about your thoughts and tools you used 
5324,himym,her body is a perfect x 
5325,himym,high v 
5326,himym,easily my favorite marshall and ted interaction 
5327,himym,same with president obama as he said recently
5328,himym,main issue from my point of view  is that show s title and season 9  which should nt have happened  but extended due to shows  popularity  raised audiences expectations about the mother we sympathized for the mother due to her frequent appearances in s9  if i accept this alternate ending as the true ending  then i would feel just terrible for robin from the beginning  creators wanted robin to end up with ted i spent <SMILE> years watching her getting along with the group instead  she ended up alone  regretting her decisions  cast aside  and prob live alone forever 
5329,himym,kinda a cheap ploy to use a two parter as one of the episodes  happy 10 got a mention  but i think a lot of the honorable mentions would ve been on my top 10 instead number 1 would probably be my number 1 though 
5330,himym,i m not sure if i m missing the joke here or something but that s not natalie portman it s sarah chalke we also would have accepted elliott
5331,himym,saw the first one twice in197<SMILE> when i was a tyke that was enough 
5332,himym, i feel like your image does nt fully capture the level of crazy in marshall s eyes     <URL> 
5333,himym,damnit  carter and bays  what happened to the love solutions girl  ted s perfect match 
5334,himym,this may sound like a cop out or even a nonanswer  but i always just sort of figure it was the idea of the person rather than an actual person yes  there was a person he was  supposed  to go and meet in the show  and she was real  but for our purposes  it was mostly to illustrate the idea of  you want what you want   he literally had his ideal  perfect woman waiting for him  but instead he chose to continue pursuing robin i mean  that was the whole point of the episode  especially with the doctor he went to see she said something like   sometimes  a 7 can feel like a perfect 10 
5335,himym,maybe it was barney creating a fake profile and listing traits ted would find desirable in a woman  like in  three days rule  where he and marshall try to woo teddy westside 
5336,himym,i wondered the same thing  it s the only remaining plot hole i can think of 
5337,himym,it s been 2 years    d 
5338,himym,i always assume it would end up like his other match  or the slutty pumpkin only perfect because ted had told himself that in his head 
5339,himym,she was engaged to marry another man she was matched to someone  lesser  than ted  in the sense that they had a lower match score   but she was happy with the guy she was with
5340,himym,she lived the star wars  though 
5341,himym,rhockeyjerseys can help you out
5342,himym,i looks like a  white atlanta thrashers jersey     <URL>  minus all logos and numbers
5343,himym,i m sorry to be that guy but this image is extremely well known  at least around where i m from   i had seen it at least five or six times in various elementarymiddle schoolhigh school classes before i watched himym
5344,himym,whilst the us enjoyed all nine seasons for time af last year  the uk was only very recently blessed with s1<SMILE> in december now  s9 has <URL> available  this is major news 
5345,himym,the slutty pumpkin   <URL> okay awesome   <URL>
5346,himym,pilot  swarley  the pineapple  bedtime stories  girls vs suits
5347,himym,game night  we know why barney is the king of marshgammon  and how he became the womanizer we all know and love  slap bet  plenty of callbacks to this episode later in the series always a good watch  three days of snow  wellwritten to allude to it being one day instead of three the ending was fantastic  and totally fits the overthetop theme of the showmarshall and lily s relationship  time travelers  i think i got more emotional with this episode than bad news or vesuvius mainly for that final speech it definitely made me hug my girlfriend  now fiancee  tight after seeing it  how your mother met me  although it was an emotional whirlwind  it was great to see tracy s life before ted  albeit for only one episode i would have liked her to be featured over multiple episodes  instead of focusing on one painfully long weekend 
5348,himym,in no real order  pilot  the pineapple incident  last forever  the best burger in new york  disaster averted  damn that was hard 
5349,himym,ca nt give specific names  but the one where ted talks about anger  the one with klaus  the one where he proposes to tracy  and the last two purely for the acting  where marshall s dad died  and when barney takes the hoop from his dad s garage 
5350,himym,swarley  slapsgiving  three days of snow  the leap  false positive  i quickly scanned all season lists and i have to say  season 5 was definitely the season where they lost inspiration 
5351,himym,no particular order  pineapple incident  s1e10  slap bet  s2e9  spoiler alert  s3e<SMILE>  bro mitzvah  s<SMILE>e22  how your mother met me  s9ep16 
5352,himym, pilot  i love a good pilot  and himym is one of my favorites ever   zoo or false  i like this because it s the commentary on the unreliable narrator that drives a story never let the truth get in the way of a good story   three days of snow  i really sweet episode with some great unexpected twist   how your mother met me  an episode nine seasons in the making  adding up everything we ve ever known about the mother   the best burger in new york  a really funny episode that has a great premise that it executes well and super strength regis 
5353,himym,in increasing order of preference  last forever pilot bad news hymmm drumroll  please
5354,himym,ps i love you  the superbowl episode where we see ted invent something new and discover the roots of barney s gambling addiction the one with the blitz guy unpause because please last words i think that s the name of the episode where robin <URL> a mini dealer at the funeral
5355,himym,in no particular order  how your mother met me  last forever  alternative ending   gary blauman  showdown  slapbet
5356,himym, how your mother met me  the pineapple incident  tick tick tick  symphony of illumination  time travelers in no particular order 
5357,himym,slap bet  do i know you   the three days rule  legendaddy  unpause
5358,himym,so here s my top five most watched episodes   pilot  karma  the broath  the magician s code  the bro mitzvah
5359,himym,this was hard to pick but here goes   pineapple incident  bad news  how your mother met me  three days of snow  perfect week tried to give a good representation over the run of the entire show 
5360,himym,come on  time travellers  daisy  legendaddy  and the final page pt 2
5361,himym,very conveniently less than 4<SMILE> hours after i finished binge rewatching 1<SMILE> 
5362,himym, oh my god  you have super mario kart   
5363,himym,i ve never seen the desire to cut off the crust
5364,himym,which episode is this
5365,himym,holy fucking shit that s fucking insane dude holy fucking shit                              i m losing my fucking mind over this     whoa     whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
5366,himym,i think someone stated that here earlier
5367,himym,oh it really is    that s great foreshadowing
5368,himym,that s one of my favorite moments
5369,himym,i still do nt understand how lily could   not   have failed to react the way that marshal and ted did 
5370,himym,one coincidental and clearly notatallonpurpose connection i like to make is the fries represent the 4 women he  s datedactually had feelings for  shannon  nora  quinn  robin   robin  the last one  was the bestmost important by far and he  stole  her  taran killam  blauman  is married to cobie smulders in real life 
5371,himym,you never take a man s accidental curly
5372,himym,no one wants all curly fries 
5373,himym,come on  i m going against the grain here by picking this instead of pilot or the pineapple incident from season 1  but this episode basically epitomizes what i loved about the series  how in tune it was with the real highs and lows of life it had the humor of barney throughout  the euphoria of ted finally getting with robin  but cue the ending scene  with marshall sitting on the steps in the rain while bloc party  this modern love plays in the backgroundi was heartbroken  and i was immediately hooked  slap bet  i love this episode for basically the complete opposite reasons i listed for  come on   this really was just a feelgood episode for me it showcased how great of friends the group really was it was just them hanging out  enjoying each other s company  and getting into all the dumb things friends get into when just sitting around doing nothing  besides finding out you re a canadian pop star   three days of snow  i really relate to this episode as someone who s now married  and has been with that person for nearly 10 years ted and barney s fiasco in the apartment during a blizzard was hilarious dude we should buy a bar but marshall and lily trying to keep up with doing the little things and making sure to keep the traditions alive after so many years together was something that really resonated with me great story editing  and loved the separate plots tying in together at the end  the leap  i started himym a few years after college  when i binged it all to catch up to season 9 while it was still airing i often think what it would have been like if i watched it live  the entire series that would have meant i would have started back in high school  and honestly i do nt think it would have hit home as hard as it did when i watched it this episode is the perfect example of that ted s voice over at the end of the episode  while they re jumping across  is something i do nt think i would have been able to relate to at an earlier age but watching it in my midtwenties  wow  this will forever be my favorite episode also  another win for himym s music supervisor with prophets playing at the end of the episode  the time travelers  i love this episode for many of the same reasons that i had for  come on   it was just an emotional roller coaster the humor in the middle of the episode had the feelgood vibes that i was accustomed to  but then ted s scene outside tracie s door comes out of nowhere josh radnor had a lot of great acting moments in the show  but to me this is his best him tearing up asking for 45 more days was one of the best moments in the whole series imo  ps thanks for the friday afternoon productivity drain  loved it the distraction 
5374,himym,arrivederci  fiero girls vs suits the pineapple incident swarley the leap
5375,himym,so what does it say about your brain if you see a duck first vs seeing a rabbit first 
5376,himym,hah me too  
5377,himym,not sure if you re serious  these have been the exact names of maltomeal s brand knockoffs for decades 
5378,himym,did nt she get married 
5379,himym,i like to think that it was tracy all along 
5380,himym,i do nt get it what s the significance of the song 
5381,himym,someone find the scene from no pressure   not like this  lily not like this 
5382,himym, major news 
5383,himym,funny thing  i just rewatched the coat check girl  episode the other night  and ted strictly says they have lots in common  like not liking things cause they think that have to   like the superbowl  he said 
5384,himym,i believe carter and craig went back and changed the background in that scene from spain to mexico because some of the images were more from mexican culture than spanish possible that you were watching two different versions 
5385,himym,the version aired in spain probably has mexico instead of the originally aired episode  which is where he traveled to spain tv shows often change foreign languages to another when it s translated to the language it uses so i d say you win my friend because in the original it s in spain   link to a screenshot of the originally aired episode on cbs  see the logo in the bottom left     <URL>
5386,himym,a perfect christmas performed by vasco amp  jerry abbot
5387,himym,so  my little sister and i are having this argument over text messages  i asked her where was ted traveling when he got the nickname  el ganso con la ri  onera   i m pretty sure it was spain she says she just saw the episode and it was mexico so  does anyone remember where it was   edit  she took this picture from netflix as proof    <URL> but then  i found this youtube video    youtubecirhi1ak<SMILE>sg and now we re even more confused 
5388,himym,i just binged watched it twice and ted and lily are horrible people  robin is okay at time and so is marshall but he can get annoying as well 
5389,himym,i never got this i see people whine about how ted was  just  the straight man  or how lily was a bitch troughout the entire series bullshit  barney and marshall were better characters than ted for sure  but ted made me laugh the most the mosby boys  when he gets cocky  when he lets barney drag him along and plays ball  man those moments were so good he is a hopeless romantic  so what  everyone deserves to find  the one   he is most definitely not boring and yeah  how lily stole christmas was a horrible episode  aldrin justice is a flawed system as ted pointed out and lily had no right to break up ted s relationships  but other than those three situations  you d have to  really  do something wrong to actually dislike or even hate one of the characters 
5390,himym,to me  barney was a sociopath  i do nt get why people were rooting for him  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  it was  shelter island  that began my loathing of barney stinson he circled  get her drunk  and  emotionally vulnerable  on a whiteboard  as part of an elaborate  premeditated scheme to have sex with robin  regardless of her wishes there s a word for that  rapist  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  i offer  sandcastles in the sand  as further evidence robin was in a vulnerable state barney and robin lingered at the bar we saw robin drinking  probably scotch  the whole time and she had a headstart on barney he arrived late if barney had waited  even a few hours  till robin was stonecold sober and less heartbroken  would robin have consented to a tryst with barney  we know from  the goat  that robin was embarrassed and remorseful the next day whatever feelings barney might have had  it was his duty  as a friend  to resist barney took advantage of robin  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  compare this to  doppelgangers  in which robin was again heartbroken and vulnerable ted warns robin that he and she are drunk and he then seems hesitant when she leans forward yes  it was lucky for ted that his awesome hair broke the spell  he was pulling it off   but future ted notes that a relapse with robin that night would have been a terrible mistake by contrast  back in  the goat  we saw barney collecting  bpegs  for his mental harddrive he had no regret he said so ted is human and nearly stumbled  he was relieved that nothing happened without remorse  barney consciously set out to recreate  sandcastles in the sand  with his  shelter island  schemeamp  nbsp   utterly despicable  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  at this point  barney supporters try to tell me that he changed  over the years no his proposal was like the recruitment strategy for a cult the recruit is kept disoriented  under stress  for several weeks and then thrown a lifeline  which the recruit instinctively grabs once indoctrinated  a cult member never looks back to question the process it is the writers  not me  who chose a hannibal lecter metaphor by having robin put herself in a pit over barney  a  silence of the lambs  reference  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  in the eighth season  barney makes a big show of destroying the play book but that was a lie not only does he own a  hoebegone   he used it on robin even robin acknowledges that barney s entire courtship was built on lies it was not until the secondtolast episode that barney finally   finally  promises to be truthful with robin that is not consistent character growth that is too little  too late 
5391,himym,consider this  if they were nt flawed characters  the show would nt have anything funny about it perfect people are nt that interesting to watch  definitely not in a comedy 
5392,himym,why do i love every character except barney 
5393,himym,people like you are the reason we got a shitty last season and a terrible finale
5394,himym,i do nt get it  am i out of the loop here or what 
5395,himym,1 dont put the punch line in the title 2 dont post from shows that are not funny
5396,himym,as eminem says  no word is unrhymable if said with the proper emphasispronunciation 
5397,himym,he also wrote the cantina music for the force awakens 
5398,himym, i ve just been handed a news flash the word canada is unrhymable  it s easier to  i do nt know  get drunk and try to climb a bull  but canada  damn it  ask any man on the planet  and watch their stammering stamina as they clamor and cram it into the middle of a sentence  for a shot at repentance  pass their problem on to all their nonrhyming descendants  i ve never met anyone who could clean up after canada  except for my uncle tony from the bronx  he s a janitor 
5399,himym,definitely one of my favorite episodes
5400,himym,i love that episode the scene where he s talking to his dad about how no one really knows where they re going in life  all you can do is just hope for the best awesome 
5401,himym,holy shit  you re so right 
5402,himym,canada is nt unrhymable  he just rhymed it with  janita   janitor  at the end of the rap
5403,himym,they broke up because they cancelled each others awesome who stopped being awesome when they got back together 
5404,himym,your goal is to have a clearly unhealthy relationship  that was the point of both the scene and the episode  bro 
5405,himym,but they were lying 
5406,himym,he was not okay thanks  he was not okay thanks at all 
5407,himym,i have not noticed that before  thanks
5408,himym,in episode 11 of season 1  robin and ted kiss at midnight on new years  eve the song playing in the background  la vie en rose 
5409,himym,holy potato quality batman
5410,himym,the later season s of himym were really running low on content 
5411,himym,this meme was created in potatoshop cs6 it s hosted on <URL> 
5412,himym,op did nt crop well enough to hide the ifunny bar at the bottom
5413,himym,more jpeg  please 
5414,himym,that scene  and to be honest that whole episode  is the highlight of the final season 
5415,himym,the shows have a lot of the same jokes  but himym seems to approach and develop the jokes differently 
5416,himym, murderrrrrrrr  climb aboard the murder traaaaain    the foreskins
5417,himym,so you are saying ted was nt tracy s the one  i disagree 
5418,himym,somebody on this sub a while back distinguished between  soulmate  and  love of life   and i think the distinction actually makes a lot of sense for the show  soulmate  means the one whom a character is most naturally matched for and drawn to  and for whom chemistry and timing both line up however  it is nt necessarily who that person spends their life with  usually because of circumstances out of their control  but sometimes because of the relationship itself    love of one s life  indicates the person that they may not be the most naturally matched for  but whom they are matched for  drawn to  and end up with ultimately and it applies to all the main characters in different ways  it should also be specified that these categories do nt necessarily imply romance   marshall and lily are both soulmates and the love of each other s lives they connect from the instant that they meet and do nt really ever let go of each other  barney s soulmate is robin  and robin s soulmate is barney but their natural chemistry  timing  and love for each other ca nt get them past themselves and their own careers  and they get divorced but barney s love of his life ends up being his daughter  ellie  whom he greets as the  love of his life  the very moment he first meets her and robin s love of her life ends up being ted  with whom she always had chemistry  but the wrong timing  tracy s soulmate is max  but he is taken from her by an early death she ends up with ted  whom she calls the  love of her life  in the show and who is with her to the very end  finally  and most important to the show overall  ted s soulmate is tracy  but she is taken from him by illness but the love of his life is robin  whom he knew for years and always felt drawn to  but without the right timing ted s telling of the story of how he met tracy occurs at the moment when chemistry finally meets timing for robin and ted  and when his kids give him their blessing to start dating again 
5419,himym,this is my favorite ted scene   d
5420,himym,maybe i did not discover the america but  while i was drawing today i realized that ted and is beloved  dead    wife had basically the same experience  both found the love of their life  but they died  and then they find someone else who s comparable to that love but not quite so but maybe more appropriate  just a fresh thought  maybe someone already noticed it just wanted to share this with all of you 
5421,himym,i said to my girlfriend yesterday that tracy never disconnected from her boyfriend after he died her boyfriend allowed her to be with ted  but ultimately  she died and went to be with him as ted was destined to be with robin forever 
5422,himym,is this your first time watching the show  i do nt want to spoil anything 
5423,himym,victoria was the best for ted fun fact  they wrote the character of victoria as a potential  mother  had the show been cancelled after 13 episodes 
5424,himym,hiding fights behind sex is bad news bears 
5425,himym,it s easier to say who s the worst than who s the best stella is the worst 
5426,himym,i think ted and victoria would have broken up whether or not he went to robin s because of the distance  and stella was just awful 
5427,himym,victoria waifu is best waifu  in all seriousness  i think they had an amazing chemistry  were mature adults in talking to each other  until problems with long distance relationships occurred  and they both wanted the same type of relationship robin did nt want marriage  or to be stuck in one situation  which is basically the opposite of what ted wanted and stella unfortunately was just a way for ted to try and move on from his past loves  and rushed into a potential marriage  when he probably should ve realized it was nt a right fit 
5428,himym,talking about twisted plots  i do nt think this is a safe place for someone who still is watching the show 
5429,himym,how dare you not give 35 year old glenmkenna credit
5430,himym,respected but at the same time so wellknown it was no stretch to include it 
5431,himym,it s funny  i ve always seen belvedere in the apartment  but i ve never seen a consistent scotch on the liquor shelf  despite everyone being able to at least tolerate it also ted mentions scotch and soda as his favorite drink  and barneyrobin obviously adore the spirit 
5432,himym,season 4  episode 12
5433,himym,you could add the funeral  by band of horses  i think it s in s<SMILE>e1 
5434,himym,i could nt find nothing suits you like a suit either to clarify i did nt make the playlist just found it and thought i d share
5435,himym,simple song is on there it s one of my favorites off the list
5436,himym,i have that song on my list but i do nt remember where i pulled it from 
5437,himym,i ca nt see  the ballad of sir frankie crisp  by george harrisons
5438,himym,no murder train 
5439,himym,got ta add heaven by the walkmen on there
5440,himym,la vie en rose mom plays on ukelele
5441,himym,after rewatching the series  i  ve noticed  this picture     <URL>  is a screenshot from the season 4 premiere   do i know you    confirmed by <URL>  correct me if i  m wrong  but isn  t he saying  that would be delightful   in that picture  he  s not even being himself that whole scene as he  s trying to impress robin on a date that she doesn  t even know is a date 
5442,himym,when kyle mclachlan s most well know role is dale cooper from twin peaks he is constantly talking into his tape recorder  named diane or is she a real person  that mystery was never solved  that is a nice little throwback  
5443,himym,wow nice catch  this show is an onion of infinite layers 
5444,himym,never noticed that  i love it time to go rewatch twin peaks again 
5445,himym,yes  obviously canada  but where at in canada  i m watching an episode now where she says she s from vancouver  but i swear i thought they ve named other areas of canada as well  also  not as relevant but in this epsiode she claims she s used to bad weather because she s from vancouver i live not even an hour from vancouver  and have been there many times  and the weather there is far far far from extreme that just gave me a little chuckle 
5446,himym,she s from vancouver in the show and the actress that plays her is from vancouver  as for the weather it may not be extreme but it s always raining and windy source  i also live in vancouver 
5447,himym,well it s a tv show  so they were exaggerating about the weather stuff for us audience i still had laughs since i used to live in minnesota and now in ca 
5448,himym,originally vancouver but moved east when she left the hockey team 
5449,himym,the only detail i remember is marshall walking down the hall at work and bilson looks at him in a really badass way through the glass and says something motivational  if i recall correctly 
5450,himym,yeah  i love this kind of realizations like the crazy eyes girl being deadpool and jim gordon s girlfriend  or carlos  that guy from the three consecutive parties on the first season  being the police officer from the walking dead 
5451,himym,arrivederci  fiero slap bet how your mother met me time travelers spoiler alert
5452,himym,towards the end of the race i noticed  when barney  ted and robin meet up right before they get to gregors from the way the three of them met up again  wouldnt robin have been there basically the same time it took them to meet on the corner before the last stretch when barney tackled ted  so why did she just run to gregors and win much sooner  obviously this is digging pretty far into the  why  factor but i just became very curious 
5453,himym,i think she also was amber aka cutthroat bitch in house  so many people who had a role in house appear on himymzoey  kevin  natalie  and umm  i ca nt think of anymore
5454,himym,it s also on the imdb trivia page 
5455,himym,shameless plug  yep we mentioned it in our podcast of return of the shirt if you like fun facts like that  check out our  podcast     <URL>  
5456,himym,my list is 1  marshall  or the mom tracey  since they introduced her she was just amazing from start to finish  2  barney 3  ted 4  robin 5  lily
5457,himym,1 swarley 2 the big fudge 3 teddy westside 4 scherbs 5 lilypad
5458,himym,who is this barney everyone is talking about  anyway  my list  1  swarley 2  swarley 3  swarley 4  swarely 5  doctor x
5459,himym,1 tracy 2 robin  this a recent change  she used to be at the bottom but she has grown on me this last rewatch  3 marshal 45  tie  lilybarney 6 ted
5460,himym,1 ted 2 marshal 3 lily 4 barney 5 robin i would nt really include the mother in the list for main characters though 
5461,himym, 1ted  2 lily and marshall  equal  3 robin  4 barney
5462,himym,robin marshall barney ted lily
5463,himym,1 ted 2 marshall 3 barney 4 robin 5 lily i identify too much with ted to not have him at number one  marshall and barney would be flipped if the show had only ran for up to four seasons  it hurts putting robin so far down but it is what it is  lily is always last sorry lily 
5464,himym,ted  robin  lily  marshall  barney
5465,himym,marshall tracey lily robin ted pile of soot barney
5466,himym,ted barney robin marsh and lils are basically 1 person so they get equal rank
5467,himym,1 marshall  he s basically me irl  just with a hot wife  2 barney 3 ted 4 lily 5 robin
5468,himym,marshall ted barney robin lily
5469,himym,1  ted 2  marshall 3  barney 4  robin 5  the mom and i do nt like lily so i do nt rank her
5470,himym,i just said  i do nt like chinese  but for real  characters in <URL> never  really  eat watch the big bang theory  they always get takeout and play with their forks while they talk maddening 
5471,himym,in ducky tie in season 9 he flips the piece of chickenshrimpwhatever into his mouth he was setting up that he ca nt use chopstick the whole time
5472,himym,when they re arguing about what america s most popular food is  barney says it s  something americans eat  like chinese   turns out it s bread 
5473,himym,this has actually been posted before and proven that it actually is nt la vie en rose it sounds very similar but the melody is nt the same 
5474,himym,pulling them off 
5475,himym, regarding the other two comments     youtubecxk_na2ivxw 
5476,himym,i agree with you op i just started watching himym last week and i ca nt stand ted  lilly and sometimes marshall  ted is just a massive pseudointellectual douche he s so mean to people  ca nt make mature decisions and when he likes a girl he just falls crazy in love and ca nt take no for an answer  it s not realistic at all especially when he does some bad things to his partners  especially robin  yet it s okay because he was reacting to something they did which is complete bs  lilly also pisses me off because she thinks she s always right and dishing out justice for the group based on some sick moral compass she does some pretty horrible things to ted too  like the episode where she calls him to ditch his date  to change her tyre in the middle of nowhere and then leave him then not call and expect everything to go back to normal and she bloody hits barney a lot  ftm violence is just as bad  i do nt care if people find it funnynot that i can see how she also ca nt keep secrets  ruins relationships and is a terrible person  just like ted is to some girls  robin and marshall are okay but not as bad now barney definitely does douchey things constantly  but i feel for him because he s the odd one out in the group always getting picked on  and i think we can only pity him because we know his sense of confidence is exaggerated and artificial based on some deeper issues in his past that he has nt dealt with and his fragile emotions  so that s why ted  lilly  evil and barney  awesome 
5477,himym,fuck this show in its entirety 
5478,himym,you could add  here i dreamt i was an architect  by the decemberists and  forest whitaker  by bad books
5479,himym,does nt even have the theme in it   <URL>  v  zqypufdndb0
5480,himym,he also was the writer and lead of in the heights  a multiple tony winning musical 
5481,himym,that was the worst fucking episode
5482,himym,isnt he in the last season of house too 
5483,himym, is orange juice ok    no  
5484,himym,gt  the first ten seconds of 301 and seriously how did nt all of us see the end coming forever ago   kids  there s more than one story of how i met your mother you know the short version  the thing with your mom s yellow umbrella but there s a bigger story the story of how i became who i had to <URL> before i could meet her that story begins here  what are you smoking and can i have some  you re hella reading into this take a step back 
5485,himym,gt  the first ten seconds of 301 and seriously how did nt all of us see the end coming forever ago  you are correct because this is when they    reset    the show and a lot of people did see it the kids apparently already knew how their parents met so the pilot episode where they thought ted met their mom at maclarens makes no sense  same as the liberty bell and our all time favorite scene from belly full of turkey  the stripper named tracy  we are introduced to the yellow umbrella and now there is a different reason that he is telling his kids this story
5486,himym, 1x01
5487,himym,what  check out the middle of season 5 episode 7 that pretty clearly demonstrates they did nt have the ending in mind until the got there  edit  and holy shit  the end of season 7 episode 16 means they thought it was going to end in a totally different way  
5488,himym,so  i m watching this episode and at lily and marshall s wedding i dunno  i ve been drinking  but just watch this episode the show was headed exactly where it went forever just because it was nt the story that a lot of us wanted  does nt mean that it s not a great story seriously  watch 222 it was how i met your mother  not how awesome your mother was and all the stuff that happened between when i met your mother and now  i thought the ending was perfect  andhad the show not ended as it had  it would have made a a lot less sense  no matter what we  the audience  wanted  edit  the first ten seconds of 301 and seriously how did nt all of us see the end coming forever ago 
5489,himym,one of my favorite ongoing jokes
5490,himym, gifv link     <URL>    faq     <URL> 
5491,himym,  <URL> it s right at the end  ca nt find it anywhere else 
5492,himym,its a christmas record and i ve been trying to find out what its called for a few years
5493,himym,hahaha this is all i thought about whilst watching the super bowl
5494,himym,i just started listening to a new tv podcast and their first episode is a friends vs how i met your mother debate it was actually really entertaining post here if you listen  i want to hear your thoughts here s the itunes link    <URL>  mt  2
5495,himym,dysfunctional person  dysfunctional person  dysfunctional relationship
5496,himym,shoutout to the writers for the total plot twist ending the whole episode i keep thinking robin and ted will be the ones rekindling but then when stella shows up on the boat  and tony right behind her my heart dropped and my mouth was wide open it was delivered amazingly  and i ca nt wait for the rest 
5497,himym,no  simple song  
5498,himym,your fresh thought makes me sad 
5499,himym,i ca nt find it anywhere online  could somebody please link it to me  thank you very much in advance btw is there a list of all the deleted scenes  i would like to see them all 
5500,himym,lily is just crazy and way to nosy 
5501,himym,i really doubt it was conscious  she just  assumed  stella knew x or y 
5502,himym,she felt that ted was just falling into someone else s life 
5503,himym,i just re watched that episode and damn it  if it was nt a great episode with an unexpected twist  like  the last scene just hits me like a truck driving 100 miles an hour on a highway makes you revalue some things in your life i guess  ps robin looks so damn hot with those glasses 
5504,himym,wait you were planning to sleep with the lead anchor  well now that i know it s sandy rivers i m not 
5505,himym, the clock is ticking   said by marshall  s mom in that episode  it kills me every time 
5506,himym,both big fights ted and stella had before getting engaged were because lily open her mouth
5507,himym,when ted tells stella they ll go to a wedding like 6 months in advance should be last half of season 3
5508,himym,i m pretty sure this is in an episode but i do nt know if it really is or not i ve had a conversation between ted and barney stuck in my head where barney finally acknowledges that he isnt teds best friend but lets ted know that he is his 
5509,himym,seriously horrible
5510,himym,oh look  another wah wah wah 
5511,himym,it s the same writers  creators who also wrote some of the best episodes so as per snother posterwah wah wah
5512,himym,y u so grumpy 
5513,himym,as a fan of the show  the ending is nt as important as the journey  seasons 1<SMILE>   but actually  you could stop right after ted meets tracey at the subway platform and walk away from the show and be totally fine 
5514,himym,has anyone tried the naked man  or has been on the receiving end of it  if so  did it work  supposedly 2 out of 3 timeslol
5515,himym,i ve tried it on my wife i m 1 for 1 so far i imagine the 2 out of 3 guarantee will hold up though 
5516,himym,dave harmon did it successfully on karen phillips in  a loving mother  back in the late 60searly 70s  which i only know bc i was raiding my dad s paperback stash 
5517,himym,every so often i will look at some actor or actresses imdb page seeing what they were in and i will stumble upon the one or few episodes of himym they were on  i immeadiately remember how terrible the finale was and how it completely ruined my love of the show i ca nt even watch old episodes anymore  i am so happy i never bought any seasons on dvd 
5518,himym, wah wah wah i did nt like the creator s conclusion of their work so i m gon na whine about it on the internet for years afterwards  
5519,himym,can we just give himym finale bashing its own subreddit yet  or is that already what this subreddit has <URL> 
5520,himym,i just finished my first run and stopped before the two part finale i ve heard this before and felt that the show was perfect as of episode 22 of the last season i have no regrets about not watching the finale but i do regret some asshole explaining the ending to me when i posted about it 
5521,himym,try binge watching it it is totally different 
5522,himym,something i need to get off my chest is that bob saget narrates the whole time and then in the last episode it s just  old  ted talking to the kids  what was the point  idk why it bothers me but it does 
5523,himym,i want to gripe about something else in season <SMILE>  i m almost done with a rewatch  while we are on the subject of complaining the whole  kennedy package  think with lily where linus has to make sure she always has a drink makes no sense in the context of her being pregnant are we really to believe that lily s logic was  i want to take the edge off but i ca nt drink so i m willing to pay  100 to make sure that i always have a non alcoholic drink in my hand   apparently stress makes her really dehydrated i know it s nit picky  but it feels like lazy writing like they really wanted the joke of lily always having a drink  so they did nt care that it made absolutely no sense 
5524,himym,the show is called how i met your mother a season after they met would have been against the whole point what the show really needed was about 20 minutes of ted grieving let her death sink in  and then bring back robin that would have solved all the issues 
5525,himym,the way they treated barney s character in the finale was probably the worst part for me they spent the whole show building up his arch and having him slowly stop being interested in the wild sleeping around ways but then they just dropped all of that instantly and had him go on a fuck spree  the finale pretty much abandoned all the character archs they had set up earlier 
5526,himym,i actually did nt mind how much the mother was in the show i think it was rather tastefully done the show was still how i met your mother  because meeting robin is what technically made barney and robin s relationship possible this in turn led to meeting the mother  that being said  i found the final three episodes a train wreck of highs and lows especially the ending 
5527,himym,as soon as the final episode ended  i cracked up i made a realization that  it s a <URL>  do nt get me wrong  since there was such a huge buildup about the mother  her appearance on the show was way less than i expected  i thought it was a great show  despite this i really enjoyed emotionally connecting to the characters  and it s really interesting how events in ted s life  seemingly unrelated to the eventual meeting of his wife  actually did relate  the fact that the show ended made me realize that  despite having an emotional connection to the characters and their story  it s over they are nt real  i   however   do  have a future  it was nice that this show was not so much  happy ever after  culturally  in the us  at least if you re brought up watching disney  etc   there s this idea of  happy every after  once you meet your spouse but that s unrealistic this show was so great because it showed how complex relationships are it s not just romanticsexual relationships  but how they relate to each other and how your friends and family fit in there s not necessarily  one   perfect  person out there or maybe we can say there is  but things do nt always work out the way you initially expect  and the fact that he gets back with robin is fitting  in my mind   they have all those great stories and memories together  and they get along  really well  as  friends  when and if i get married  i want my spouse to be my best friend  that s my two cents 
5528,himym,in all fairness the show is titled how i  met  your mother  not how i dated your mother i assume that the kids already know things about their mother s life and how their early relationship went  if not how they met he even says that they know the short version of the story it was  supposed  to end when they meet 
5529,himym,does she know about the  official alternate ending      <URL>  v  rohus<SMILE>j7x94 
5530,himym,one of us   
5531,himym,i really wish it would have showed somthing about how barney s daughter ended up or at least had a scene with the mother of his kid
5532,himym,sounds like you ve got a keeper 
5533,himym,maybe the mother was right for him at the time  like barney s short successful  marriage that ended maybe forever is too long to expect anything to last that another theme is that perfect moments  albeit short  are all we can really expect 
5534,himym,there was a fan edit a while back that was absolutely perfect same <URL>  but you walk away feeling a bit more comfortable with it  since the way it was cut really shows that ted and tracy had an amazing life together for a pretty long time  keep in mind the kids are in their teens and she s been gone for about 6 years   and that she would have wanted him to move on once that sting is out you really get to see the artistic vision behind the show it speaks a lot about fatedestiny  and a big part of the theme was always how what might be right for you at one point in your life  might not be right for you later on or viceversa  the shirt    in his 30 s40 s tracy was what he needed someone to start a family with and at that same time barney was what robin needed  someone to keep her company while she lived out her dream career but later on in life ted already having the kids  and them being mostly grown up  and robin being  well  robin they were what they needed then even his kids encourage him to go get her  but i m rambling  my point is  the video seems to have disappeared but i ll bet if you look hard enough you can find it it s much better and i m sure your gf would love it   ps  if you ca nt find it  i think i have it downloaded on my old computer let me know and if i can find it  i ll upload it to dropbox or something 
5535,himym, you re
5536,himym,the last season was embarrassingly bad 
5537,himym,rando i love it 
5538,himym,was he eating a sandwich during this scene 
5539,himym,does anyone think that part of the reason tracy and ted worked out was because for the first year  lily and marshall were in italy and barney and robin were traveling andor simply not around  i know it was supposed to be because she was so good for him etc but i ca nt stop thinking about how the friends would have somehow caused a problem 
5540,himym,thats actually a really good point while marshall never interfered with teds love life lily certainly had a hand in some break ups over the series  and with robin no longer an option at all along with barney out of his womanizing ways ted had the ability to nurture a relationship while not constantly around heavily codependant and meddling people nice fan theory 
5541,himym,something the writers went to great lengths to establish was the gang s warmth towards tracy  especially lily one can only assume this was to show that unlike many of ted s other trainwreck partners  tracy was sound and the meddling would have been minimal 
5542,himym,do you think ted s friends killed her 
5543,himym,timing    <URL>
5544,himym,it s not a bad point  but to be fair it s pretty well established that they re absolutely perfect for each other in a way that no other girl that ted ever dated really was 
5545,himym,i think it s pretty well established that part of why they worked was because robin was off the marketout of the picture for a long time but the part about the others never occurred to me great point  op 
5546,himym,hello  i was wondering if the score for himym was ever released  not the soundtrack  but the score  all of the original instrumental music that was written for the show   i ca nt seem to find it anywhere  but i figured i d ask thanks 
5547,himym,it s not the entire score  not even close lol   but  john swihart s soundcloud     <URL>  has 20something tracks hopefully one day  he can release a lot more anything in particular you were looking for 
5548,himym,spotify
5549,himym,sorry  but no not the original ones 
5550,himym,you should also check out freestyle love supreme
5551,himym,i noticed this so many times  like he tries so had with the chopsticks  and never succeeds 
5552,himym, she s the first on this list     <URL> 
5553,himym,i ve always wondered if they did this on purpose as an homage to friends 
5554,himym,1 marshall 2 barney 3 lilly 4 ted 5 robin
5555,himym,i m sorry to be that guy but this image is extremely well known  at least around where i m from   i had seen it at least five or six times in various elementarymiddle schoolhigh school classes before i watched himym
5556,himym,so what does it say about your brain if you see a duck first vs seeing a rabbit first 
5557,himym,but the real question is  is it white and gold or blue and black 
5558,himym,i do nt know when it first aired but it played a few times in the show i m on how your mother met me and the mother is talking to dead max and the song is playing  just wanted to know if there is a full recording of that melody or if it s just that piece 
5559,himym,i dont think it shows up before season 9  where they then abuse the shit out of it i seriously hate that little melody  himym got me well conditioned to expect great sadness immediately following it sorry i do nt have a link  i just really hate that piano line 
5560,himym,i have a copy of it i used it in my fan made ending i ll upload it when possible 
5561,himym, here you go     <URL>  v  khioxdpn_9o   it first aired in  the time travelers  and the song is named  you  re all alone  after the line from the episode when we realise no one else is at the bar and it  s all ted  s imagination 
5562,himym,the slutty pumpkin   <URL> okay awesome   <URL>
5563,himym,both big fights ted and stella had before getting engaged were because lily open her mouth
5564,himym,lily is just crazy and way to nosy 
5565,himym,i really doubt it was conscious  she just  assumed  stella knew x or y 
5566,himym,she felt that ted was just falling into someone else s life 
5567,himym,i have noticed this many a times but whenever they have chinese food barney always fails to eat his food he always tries but it always falls
5568,himym,the only detail i remember is marshall walking down the hall at work and bilson looks at him in a really badass way through the glass and says something motivational  if i recall correctly 
5569,himym,season 4  episode 12
5570,himym, murderrrrrrrr  climb aboard the murder traaaaain    the foreskins
5571,himym,i just re watched that episode and damn it  if it was nt a great episode with an unexpected twist  like  the last scene just hits me like a truck driving 100 miles an hour on a highway makes you revalue some things in your life i guess  ps robin looks so damn hot with those glasses 
5572,himym,wait you were planning to sleep with the lead anchor  well now that i know it s sandy rivers i m not 
5573,himym, the clock is ticking   said by marshall  s mom in that episode  it kills me every time 
5574,himym,oh the barnacle has eaten his fair share of chinese 
5575,himym,i just noticed  when marshall is first watching the you can call me beercules video at about 6m15s there are thumbnail videos in the right corner for the later videodo you think its on purpose or a mistake 
5576,himym,i ca nt find it anywhere online  could somebody please link it to me  thank you very much in advance btw is there a list of all the deleted scenes  i would like to see them all 
5577,himym,  <URL> it s right at the end  ca nt find it anywhere else 
5578,himym,damnit  carter and bays  what happened to the love solutions girl  ted s perfect match 
5579,himym,i always assume it would end up like his other match  or the slutty pumpkin only perfect because ted had told himself that in his head 
5580,himym,this may sound like a cop out or even a nonanswer  but i always just sort of figure it was the idea of the person rather than an actual person yes  there was a person he was  supposed  to go and meet in the show  and she was real  but for our purposes  it was mostly to illustrate the idea of  you want what you want   he literally had his ideal  perfect woman waiting for him  but instead he chose to continue pursuing robin i mean  that was the whole point of the episode  especially with the doctor he went to see she said something like   sometimes  a 7 can feel like a perfect 10 
5581,himym,i like to think that it was tracy all along 
5582,himym,did nt she get married 
5583,himym,it s been 2 years    d 
5584,himym,maybe it was barney creating a fake profile and listing traits ted would find desirable in a woman  like in  three days rule  where he and marshall try to woo teddy westside 
5585,himym,i wondered the same thing  it s the only remaining plot hole i can think of 
5586,himym,she was engaged to marry another man she was matched to someone  lesser  than ted  in the sense that they had a lower match score   but she was happy with the guy she was with
5587,himym,so i ve seen up to season 6 of the show and so far ted has had about 3 major love interests  victoria  stella  and robin i m arguing with my friends saying that victoria is the better of the three because she and ted never really fought  until the end of their relationship  and they would ve had a really long relationship had ted not been an idiot and gone over to robin s place that one night anyway  point is  two other friends of mine argue for stella and robin so who do you think was better for ted and why 
5588,himym,it s much like love in the time of cholera by pablo neruda in this way 
5589,himym,this entire playlist should have been  im gon na be  on an infinite loop as a gag
5590,himym,when kyle mclachlan s most well know role is dale cooper from twin peaks he is constantly talking into his tape recorder  named diane or is she a real person  that mystery was never solved  that is a nice little throwback  
5591,himym,wow nice catch  this show is an onion of infinite layers 
5592,himym,never noticed that  i love it time to go rewatch twin peaks again 
5593,himym,mine is probably either the beaver song  p s i love you or nothing suits me like a suit 
5594,himym,let s go to the mall without a doubt  sandcastles in the sand is my runner up  robin sparkles was amazing 
5595,himym,cristin milioti s version of la vie en rose man that song haunts me  i also sing sandcastle s in the sand on a daily basis so there s that  
5596,himym,boyz ii men  you just got slapped
5597,himym,awesome thank you 
5598,himym,thank you so much  to me  this music is an outward  ascending spiral of joy  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  does anybody know how to transform a youtube post into an  mp3  file i would like to use this music on my alarm clock  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  as i have stated before  this music would make a really cool wedding recessional 
5599,himym,what is the story behind this music  do you know who the composer and arranger was  it sounds a bit like a  hey  beautiful  arrangement but i m just not sure 
5600,himym,this is nice  did you make this  or is it from an episode 
5601,himym, i m not looking to problemsolve  i m just looking to listen 
5602,himym,describe them 
5603,himym,pulling them off 
5604,himym,so i ve seen up to season 6 of the show and so far ted has had about 3 major love interests  victoria  stella  and robin i m arguing with my friends saying that victoria is the better of the three because she and ted never really fought  until the end of their relationship  and they would ve had a really long relationship had ted not been an idiot and gone over to robin s place that one night anyway  point is  two other friends of mine argue for stella and robin so who do you think was better for ted and why 
5605,himym,it s easier to say who s the worst than who s the best stella is the worst 
5606,himym,is this your first time watching the show  i do nt want to spoil anything 
5607,himym,victoria waifu is best waifu  in all seriousness  i think they had an amazing chemistry  were mature adults in talking to each other  until problems with long distance relationships occurred  and they both wanted the same type of relationship robin did nt want marriage  or to be stuck in one situation  which is basically the opposite of what ted wanted and stella unfortunately was just a way for ted to try and move on from his past loves  and rushed into a potential marriage  when he probably should ve realized it was nt a right fit 
5608,himym,i think ted and victoria would have broken up whether or not he went to robin s because of the distance  and stella was just awful 
5609,himym,victoria was the best for ted fun fact  they wrote the character of victoria as a potential  mother  had the show been cancelled after 13 episodes 
5610,himym,much like valentine s day itself  desperation day dates back thousands of years weddings were forbidden under ancient roman law  so st valentine performed them in secret  under threat of death 
5611,himym,high v 
5612,himym,her body is a perfect x 
5613,himym,  <URL>  v  e2gnjwj0vm0
5614,himym,i was looking for a sign for doing something legendary tonight because of desperation day you my friend gave me the green light
5615,himym,i do nt get it  am i out of the loop here or what 
5616,himym,funny thing  i just rewatched the coat check girl  episode the other night  and ted strictly says they have lots in common  like not liking things cause they think that have to   like the superbowl  he said 
5617,himym,hahaha this is all i thought about whilst watching the super bowl
5618,himym,reddit post  everybody drink 
5619,himym,this is special we need to do this every year promise me 
5620,himym,and for those who ca nt let s hope the tivo gods are in a good mood today  but if they re not i want to help  i have a sledgehammer
5621,himym,hahaha that was my first thought today as well streaming it here in australia  while at work  shhh   so no one to watch it with 
5622,himym,every time i watch this episode all i can think about are those wings and dipping sauce 
5623,himym,interesting how barney s gambling addiction was started by marshall
5624,himym,but they were lying 
5625,himym,hiding fights behind sex is bad news bears 
5626,himym,your goal is to have a clearly unhealthy relationship  that was the point of both the scene and the episode  bro 
5627,himym,dysfunctional person  dysfunctional person  dysfunctional relationship
5628,himym,they broke up because they cancelled each others awesome who stopped being awesome when they got back together 
5629,himym,i saw that someone put season 9 of himym into a movie  so i decided to reedit a more satisfying conclusion to the show  using footage from episodes 22  23 and 24 to try and make a  good finale     uloztonetxxt7krtchimymfinaleavi   hope you all enjoy  just open the link and you should be able to download it if there are any questions i d be happy to answer  and thanks to thegimboid for the idea 
5630,himym,kinda a cheap ploy to use a two parter as one of the episodes  happy 10 got a mention  but i think a lot of the honorable mentions would ve been on my top 10 instead number 1 would probably be my number 1 though 
5631,himym,marshal <URL> a state supreme court judge  lily <URL> an art consultant in italy  ted designs a high ride building in new york  robin <URL> a star news anchor  barney just gets rich doing basically nothing 
5632,himym,it s almost like its a tv show 
5633,himym,do nt forget robin was a teenage popstar 
5634,himym,watch parks and rec i love that show  but the ridiculous success of every single person that worked in the parks department in fucking pawnee  indiana makes me feel infuriatingly inadequate 
5635,himym,do nt forget first season where marshall is in grad school and ted is a peon in an architecture film  yet they can still afford a big apartment in nyc 
5636,himym,when people say barney does nt work   pssh  please
5637,himym,but we re gon na kill the mom because it s  realistic  even though nothing else is  this fucking show i still have trouble watching it after that finale 
5638,himym,success and economic levels tend to be very distorted on tv 
5639,himym,so did i watch the show  yes i did 
5640,himym,in a way  it s easier to write people ho who do nt have to worry much about such material things 
5641,himym,yes  obviously canada  but where at in canada  i m watching an episode now where she says she s from vancouver  but i swear i thought they ve named other areas of canada as well  also  not as relevant but in this epsiode she claims she s used to bad weather because she s from vancouver i live not even an hour from vancouver  and have been there many times  and the weather there is far far far from extreme that just gave me a little chuckle 
5642,himym,she s from vancouver in the show and the actress that plays her is from vancouver  as for the weather it may not be extreme but it s always raining and windy source  i also live in vancouver 
5643,himym,well it s a tv show  so they were exaggerating about the weather stuff for us audience i still had laughs since i used to live in minnesota and now in ca 
5644,himym,originally vancouver but moved east when she left the hockey team 
5645,himym,is nt that hauntingly beautiful 
5646,himym,still does nt explain the pineapple 
5647,himym,here is what the linked meme says in case it is blocked at your schoolwork or is unavailable for any reason      himym finale fail roll    gt     post title      how the himym writers came up with that finale  gt     top      ted s met the mother what do you do now   gt     bottom      end the show with the happy ending everyone wants    original link  1     <URL>    meme template  2     <URL> 
5648,himym,you never take a man s accidental curly
5649,himym,he was not okay thanks  he was not okay thanks at all 
5650,himym,this meme was created in potatoshop cs6 it s hosted on <URL> 
5651,himym,that s one of my favorite moments
5652,himym,i still do nt understand how lily could   not   have failed to react the way that marshal and ted did 
5653,himym,holy potato quality batman
5654,himym,no one wants all curly fries 
5655,himym,that scene  and to be honest that whole episode  is the highlight of the final season 
5656,himym,more jpeg  please 
5657,himym,op did nt crop well enough to hide the ifunny bar at the bottom
5658,himym,one coincidental and clearly notatallonpurpose connection i like to make is the fries represent the 4 women he  s datedactually had feelings for  shannon  nora  quinn  robin   robin  the last one  was the bestmost important by far and he  stole  her  taran killam  blauman  is married to cobie smulders in real life 
5659,himym,the later season s of himym were really running low on content 
5660,himym,okay  so i m 100  sure i m  obviously  not the only one who s noticed this  but i thought i d share something funny i noticed  season 9 episode 12   the rehearsal dinner  the gang is sitting at the bar  cracking jokes about what weddings would be like in canada after a few cracks  robin states   two mitten jokes in a rowso you re pretty much done now  to which ted narrates   kids  we were nt even close  now  watch the background when the jokes continue to emphasize just how long their jokes go on  there s a whole story that unfolds for a family behind them it s the same people in the background throughout the little scene  just a funny thing i noticed  did anyone else catch it 
5661,himym,yup  i miss 2014 
5662,himym,yesh 
5663,himym,yes this has been caught hundreds and hundreds of times it literally gets posted here at least once a week 
5664,himym,herein lies a potential minor spoiler yeah  i know  people hate  this actor is in this movie  too  it s like discovering robin in charge of helicarrier anywaycobie smulders is in the movie results basically  she s a physical trainer that apparently runs a lot while talking to a client  the words came out of her mouth  spoiler   s  but  um   not only did i lol and scare the crap out of my cat  but i also had this strange compulsion to take a shot  
5665,himym,is the movie any good 
5666,himym,mine is probably either the beaver song  p s i love you or nothing suits me like a suit 
5667,himym,let s go to the mall without a doubt  sandcastles in the sand is my runner up  robin sparkles was amazing 
5668,himym,cristin milioti s version of la vie en rose man that song haunts me  i also sing sandcastle s in the sand on a daily basis so there s that  
5669,himym,boyz ii men  you just got slapped
5670,himym,much like valentine s day itself  desperation day dates back thousands of years weddings were forbidden under ancient roman law  so st valentine performed them in secret  under threat of death

5674,himym,i was looking for a sign for doing something legendary tonight because of desperation day you my friend gave me the green light
5675,himym,i am simply creating a discussion thread for those who have binged the entire final season  i watched it live  thought it was ok  and then binged the season one lazy sunday i enjoyed it so much more after this way i encourage you all to give this a shot  particularly if you did nt like the finale 
5676,himym,i did enjoy it more this way as well season 9 gets such a bad rep
5677,himym,def the way to go imo it makes the season make a lot more sense  in a time scale  which i found made it a really enjoyable experience  although i never watched it live in the first place  
5678,himym,currently watching season 9 again the first time around i felt distracted watching it because i was just anticipating the finale this time i can pay a lot more attention although  i still find the drag out of the two days a little tedious 
5679,himym,the last season definitely holds up a lot better after having two years between viewings as josh radnor said  the show will age well i m glad to report that has happened for me  at least  slapsgiving 3  slappointment in slapmarra was still the worst episode of any show ever though 
5680,himym,i watched season 9 live and did nt really enjoy it i m currently binging now and i m still not feeling it  i feel like himym ran for two seasons too long i love seasons 17  the first half of season <SMILE> is okay  the second half of season <SMILE> was a chore to get through  and season 9 is making me lose interest in the show altogether it seems like the showrunners ran out of ideas and phoned in the last two seasons 
5681,himym,it s much better but also leads to incredible mood swings  especially from james 
5682,himym,yeah me too i just finished a rewatch of the entire series i always thought that 13 were phenomenal  4 great  5 okay and 79 horrible this time up until season 6 it was a good show  seasons 7 and <SMILE> had some really cringey moments  but most of the last season  even the rhyming episode i hated the first time around was good comedy 
5683,himym,i watched the whole series again and it just makes a lot more sense in my opinion i loooove it would ve loved a little less wedding and a little more tracy and ted  but it was still awesome 
5684,himym,yeah much better then when i watched it live also i m catching stuff i did nt notice s9e19 if you do nt know the giant hints in the episode already go watch it and do nt read anymore  3 times they give hints that she s about to die it s so sad catching it now i ca nt believe i missed it but at the same time i was only half watching it 
5685,himym,i ll paraphrase what i said in a similar discussion not too long ago about this  i was nt able to completely watch s9 when it aired  due to my workschool schedule the finale aired at the start of my spring break  so i spent all of the preceding weekend binge watching the first 22 episodes in preparation for it when i finally saw the reviews the season had gotten so far  i was a bit confused because i did nt mind it so much watching the episodes nearly backtoback keeps it from dragging on too much  and it was easy to get through the filler episodes  that said  i still feel like they would ve been better off making it a condensed season of 13 or so episodes  and letting the finale air with its original planned length 
5686,himym,has anyone tried the naked man  or has been on the receiving end of it  if so  did it work  supposedly 2 out of 3 timeslol
5687,himym,i ve tried it on my wife i m 1 for 1 so far i imagine the 2 out of 3 guarantee will hold up though 
5688,himym,dave harmon did it successfully on karen phillips in  a loving mother  back in the late 60searly 70s  which i only know bc i was raiding my dad s paperback stash 
5689,himym,i was rewatching the slap bet episode and i noticed something that really bugged me when marshall slapped barney prematurely and was wrong barney got two slaps on marshall but then when barney did the same thing to marshall lily made him choose between ten slaps immediately or five at any time  thats absurdly biased by lily and not at all fair the slap bet commissioner is supposed to be impartial 
5690,himym,to be fair swarley slapped marshall three times  while marshal had only slapped swarely once  so if we say  every time one of them slaps the other prematurely they get two additional slaps  then after swarely slapped marshal 3 times that s 6 slaps  plus the one for winning the bet  so 7  this presents lily with a rounding issue  because who wants to give out 7 slaps  10 right away or 5 across slapternity seems about equal  and 7 is in the middle 5 and 10  roughly  so it seems fair
5691,himym,did nt barney have to agree to lily s being named sbc  once all parties agree on the sbc  all rulings <URL>  fair  he had every reason to expect that she would favor marshall over him  and to know that he was nt exactly her favorite person  tho  of course  this is the same guy who insists that he is ted s best friend  so 
5692,himym,to be honest  it was dumb for barney to even agree for lily to be the sbc  there s no way she was going to be impartial however  lily should have done a better job and this is on my list of reasons why i dislike lily 
5693,himym,in the episode where ted is visited by future copies of himself and barney to try to talk him into robots v wrestlers  what s the point of this episode  i ve seen it at least 10 times and all i gather from it is that it s unnecessarily sad for no reason 
5694,himym,this is my favorite episode it s just meant to make you sad and realize how ted s life is the only one not going anywhere and it s a lot more poignant once you see the ending of the series 
5695,himym,i request the highest of dabs
5696,himym,then why does it say super bowl 46 on that guys hat 
5697,himym,is that key in front of him 
5698,himym,cougars  barney does nt normally go over 30 as far as i can remember 
5699,himym,he has a long arm  
5700,himym,as we know  the only backup mother was going to be victoria she and ted met at a wedding  just like tracy and ted did obviously c and c had this plan of  one love story ending as another one begins   but i do nt know
5701,himym,to my understanding  stella was also an option preseason 4 if the show did nt get renewed 
5702,himym, spoilers  i would have hated having victoria end up as the mother even with the way it ended with the mother dying  victoria would have made me even more disappointing with the show 
5703,himym,yes  obviously canada  but where at in canada  i m watching an episode now where she says she s from vancouver  but i swear i thought they ve named other areas of canada as well  also  not as relevant but in this epsiode she claims she s used to bad weather because she s from vancouver i live not even an hour from vancouver  and have been there many times  and the weather there is far far far from extreme that just gave me a little chuckle 
5704,himym,she s from vancouver in the show and the actress that plays her is from vancouver  as for the weather it may not be extreme but it s always raining and windy source  i also live in vancouver 
5705,himym,well it s a tv show  so they were exaggerating about the weather stuff for us audience i still had laughs since i used to live in minnesota and now in ca 
5706,himym,originally vancouver but moved east when she left the hockey team 
5707,himym,i m pretty sure this is in an episode but i do nt know if it really is or not i ve had a conversation between ted and barney stuck in my head where barney finally acknowledges that he isnt teds best friend but lets ted know that he is his 
5708,himym,hello  i was wondering if the score for himym was ever released  not the soundtrack  but the score  all of the original instrumental music that was written for the show   i ca nt seem to find it anywhere  but i figured i d ask thanks 
5709,himym,it s not the entire score  not even close lol   but  john swihart s soundcloud     <URL>  has 20something tracks hopefully one day  he can release a lot more anything in particular you were looking for 
5710,himym,spotify
5711,himym,sorry  but no not the original ones 
5712,himym,after the experience i can only assume a person would have starring in those movies  how can i blame her 
5713,himym,she lived the star wars  though 
5714,himym, i feel like your image does nt fully capture the level of crazy in marshall s eyes     <URL> 
5715,himym,easily my favorite marshall and ted interaction 
5716,himym,same with president obama as he said recently
5717,himym,she also said her career was nearly ruined by star wars why would she want to relive that 
5718,himym,why would she  the prequels made directors think for years that she was a shitty actress 
5719,himym,saw the first one twice in197<SMILE> when i was a tyke that was enough 
5720,himym,i m not sure if i m missing the joke here or something but that s not natalie portman it s sarah chalke we also would have accepted elliott
5721,himym,delivery improves the lines a lot  how about a vidya 
5722,himym,definitely i did nt like the season when i was watching it as it aired  but enjoyed it so much more while rerunning the entire series even the finale seemed enjoyable and i did nt hate it  might have even liked it  especially since i was a ted and robin rooter   if you felt disappointed by the last season and the finale  you should definitely revisit it and binge it 
5723,himym,you might be thinking of s1 ep 3 where they lick the liberty bell barney said something along the lines of   because you re my best friend ok you do nt have to tell me i m yours  this is from memory though so i could be wrong  but that s what i remember 
5724,himym,i m sure they ll do better with how i met your father 
5725,himym,i ve been watching the show for the first time and i already know all about the finale of the show and the ending i do nt want that ending  is there a fan edit of the final episode with less divorce  fewer deaths  and no robin  ted 
5726,himym,i feel like people who do nt want to watch the original ending are just in denial 
5727,himym,the best i can give you is mine  that keeps the ending but makes it flow a lot better if you want the one that you re describing  you re going to have to wait for a few more weeks until i finish my new edited finale    <URL>
5728,himym,yes    <URL>  v  rohus<SMILE>j7x94
5729,himym,towards the end of the race i noticed  when barney  ted and robin meet up right before they get to gregors from the way the three of them met up again  wouldnt robin have been there basically the same time it took them to meet on the corner before the last stretch when barney tackled ted  so why did she just run to gregors and win much sooner  obviously this is digging pretty far into the  why  factor but i just became very curious 
5730,himym,  <URL>
5731,himym,this is really cutting it close as to what counts as relevant to this sub 
5732,himym,february 2nd at 1  0<SMILE>am central my daughter was born into this world unfortunately since the mother and i are nt on good terms at all i was nt allowed to attend here i am two days later and i finally got to meet my daughter facetoface and just as barney suspected he would act in season 9 episode 24  i thought i would nt feel different at all and that i would be a cold soul about it all  practically disregarding the fact that i even had a daughter  the second i laid my eyes on her i took hold of her and the only thing i could manage to tell her was  you are the love of my life everything i have and everything i am is yours forever   himym foreshadowed how i would react to meeting my daughter down to the teary hug i had with her after i told her 
5733,himym,congrats  you re going to love that girl so much 
5734,himym,congratulations 
5735,himym,her name better be wait for it
5736,himym,congrats  let us know if you need a shotgun or help beating up some dudes in 13 years 
5737,himym,congratulations  i hope everything works out amicably with the mother 
5738,himym,i remember those feelings 
5739,himym,mazel tov 
5740,himym,wow  got a little attention  i figured it would seep through the cracks thanks everyone for your kind words of sincerity  
5741,himym,no matter what kind of relationship you have with her mother  be a freaking awesome dad for her
5742,himym,so  my little sister and i are having this argument over text messages  i asked her where was ted traveling when he got the nickname  el ganso con la ri  onera   i m pretty sure it was spain she says she just saw the episode and it was mexico so  does anyone remember where it was   edit  she took this picture from netflix as proof    <URL> but then  i found this youtube video    youtubecirhi1ak<SMILE>sg and now we re even more confused 
5743,himym,i believe carter and craig went back and changed the background in that scene from spain to mexico because some of the images were more from mexican culture than spanish possible that you were watching two different versions 
5744,himym,the version aired in spain probably has mexico instead of the originally aired episode  which is where he traveled to spain tv shows often change foreign languages to another when it s translated to the language it uses so i d say you win my friend because in the original it s in spain   link to a screenshot of the originally aired episode on cbs  see the logo in the bottom left     <URL>
5745,himym,i like  marshall barney robin lilly ted
5746,himym,i just feel the need to get this off my chest i finished the series and immediately went to reddit to find this sub the whole show built up to nothing what the fuck  im so angry i wan na punch everyone in the show please share your initial anger with me thank you 
5747,himym,the whole show was great and the finale was very good i swear  all this sub is about at this point is complaining about the ending 
5748,himym,they should just rename it  how i never got over your aunt robin 
5749,himym,give it a year i promise you ll come around  i was the same way when i watched the finale because the shock took over if you watch it later on with perspective  you ll find it s actually a very fitting and appropriate ending 
5750,himym,i think you ll find that a lot of people who still post in this sub are people who were okay with the ending i personally really hated it and it took me a while to come back to the show now i can watch the reruns and enjoy it again because everything up until the end makes for one of my favorite <URL> ever i wo nt ever agree with how they ended it but they did what they did  so i ll just continue to enjoy the parts of the show that i loved  which is most of it  
5751,himym,i do nt love the finale because it s obviously supposed to be depressing  most of it anyway  but i understand it completely i do nt know why but i just knew they would get back together eventually  i just did nt know it would be the finale  the mother and barney and robin hurt my heart though 
5752,himym,try mine instead    let me know what you think    <URL>
5753,himym,someone find the scene from no pressure   not like this  lily not like this 
5754,himym,this was hard to pick but here goes   pineapple incident  bad news  how your mother met me  three days of snow  perfect week tried to give a good representation over the run of the entire show 
5755,himym,pilot  swarley  the pineapple  bedtime stories  girls vs suits
5756,himym,game night  we know why barney is the king of marshgammon  and how he became the womanizer we all know and love  slap bet  plenty of callbacks to this episode later in the series always a good watch  three days of snow  wellwritten to allude to it being one day instead of three the ending was fantastic  and totally fits the overthetop theme of the showmarshall and lily s relationship  time travelers  i think i got more emotional with this episode than bad news or vesuvius mainly for that final speech it definitely made me hug my girlfriend  now fiancee  tight after seeing it  how your mother met me  although it was an emotional whirlwind  it was great to see tracy s life before ted  albeit for only one episode i would have liked her to be featured over multiple episodes  instead of focusing on one painfully long weekend 
5757,himym,in no real order  pilot  the pineapple incident  last forever  the best burger in new york  disaster averted  damn that was hard 
5758,himym, how your mother met me  the pineapple incident  tick tick tick  symphony of illumination  time travelers in no particular order 
5759,himym,ca nt give specific names  but the one where ted talks about anger  the one with klaus  the one where he proposes to tracy  and the last two purely for the acting  where marshall s dad died  and when barney takes the hoop from his dad s garage 
5760,himym,swarley  slapsgiving  three days of snow  the leap  false positive  i quickly scanned all season lists and i have to say  season 5 was definitely the season where they lost inspiration 
5761,himym,slap bet  do i know you   the three days rule  legendaddy  unpause
5762,himym,arrivederci  fiero slap bet how your mother met me time travelers spoiler alert
5763,himym,so here s my top five most watched episodes   pilot  karma  the broath  the magician s code  the bro mitzvah
5764,himym,no particular order  pineapple incident  s1e10  slap bet  s2e9  spoiler alert  s3e<SMILE>  bro mitzvah  s<SMILE>e22  how your mother met me  s9ep16 
5765,himym,come on  i m going against the grain here by picking this instead of pilot or the pineapple incident from season 1  but this episode basically epitomizes what i loved about the series  how in tune it was with the real highs and lows of life it had the humor of barney throughout  the euphoria of ted finally getting with robin  but cue the ending scene  with marshall sitting on the steps in the rain while bloc party  this modern love plays in the backgroundi was heartbroken  and i was immediately hooked  slap bet  i love this episode for basically the complete opposite reasons i listed for  come on   this really was just a feelgood episode for me it showcased how great of friends the group really was it was just them hanging out  enjoying each other s company  and getting into all the dumb things friends get into when just sitting around doing nothing  besides finding out you re a canadian pop star   three days of snow  i really relate to this episode as someone who s now married  and has been with that person for nearly 10 years ted and barney s fiasco in the apartment during a blizzard was hilarious dude we should buy a bar but marshall and lily trying to keep up with doing the little things and making sure to keep the traditions alive after so many years together was something that really resonated with me great story editing  and loved the separate plots tying in together at the end  the leap  i started himym a few years after college  when i binged it all to catch up to season 9 while it was still airing i often think what it would have been like if i watched it live  the entire series that would have meant i would have started back in high school  and honestly i do nt think it would have hit home as hard as it did when i watched it this episode is the perfect example of that ted s voice over at the end of the episode  while they re jumping across  is something i do nt think i would have been able to relate to at an earlier age but watching it in my midtwenties  wow  this will forever be my favorite episode also  another win for himym s music supervisor with prophets playing at the end of the episode  the time travelers  i love this episode for many of the same reasons that i had for  come on   it was just an emotional roller coaster the humor in the middle of the episode had the feelgood vibes that i was accustomed to  but then ted s scene outside tracie s door comes out of nowhere josh radnor had a lot of great acting moments in the show  but to me this is his best him tearing up asking for 45 more days was one of the best moments in the whole series imo  ps thanks for the friday afternoon productivity drain  loved it the distraction 
5766,himym, pilot  i love a good pilot  and himym is one of my favorites ever   zoo or false  i like this because it s the commentary on the unreliable narrator that drives a story never let the truth get in the way of a good story   three days of snow  i really sweet episode with some great unexpected twist   how your mother met me  an episode nine seasons in the making  adding up everything we ve ever known about the mother   the best burger in new york  a really funny episode that has a great premise that it executes well and super strength regis 
5767,himym,in no particular order  how your mother met me  last forever  alternative ending   gary blauman  showdown  slapbet
5768,himym,arrivederci  fiero girls vs suits the pineapple incident swarley the leap
5769,himym,in increasing order of preference  last forever pilot bad news hymmm drumroll  please
5770,himym,come on  time travellers  daisy  legendaddy  and the final page pt 2
5771,himym,ps i love you  the superbowl episode where we see ted invent something new and discover the roots of barney s gambling addiction the one with the blitz guy unpause because please last words i think that s the name of the episode where robin <URL> a mini dealer at the funeral
5772,himym,i love the random asian kid taking notes in the class 
5773,himym,ted has to teach barney about robin because barney is not interested in finding these things out for himself  even at the end robin is more impressed with ted for knowing and remembering all these things about her
5774,himym,awesome thank you 
5775,himym,thank you so much  to me  this music is an outward  ascending spiral of joy  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  does anybody know how to transform a youtube post into an  mp3  file i would like to use this music on my alarm clock  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  as i have stated before  this music would make a really cool wedding recessional 
5776,himym,what is the story behind this music  do you know who the composer and arranger was  it sounds a bit like a  hey  beautiful  arrangement but i m just not sure 
5777,himym,this is nice  did you make this  or is it from an episode 
5778,himym,i think it was a good ending could ve done better since we all want to see more of the mother  but if you look at the entirety of it the entire build up revolves around ted and robin and considering that the mother never intervened throughout the whole story telling makes so much sense that something happened to the mother  well she got sick and died  what a clich   
5779,himym,seriously horrible
5780,himym,oh look  another wah wah wah 
5781,himym,it s the same writers  creators who also wrote some of the best episodes so as per snother posterwah wah wah
5782,himym,y u so grumpy 
5783,himym,as a fan of the show  the ending is nt as important as the journey  seasons 1<SMILE>   but actually  you could stop right after ted meets tracey at the subway platform and walk away from the show and be totally fine 
5784,himym,i m sure they ll do better with how i met your father 
5785,himym,i want to gripe about something else in season <SMILE>  i m almost done with a rewatch  while we are on the subject of complaining the whole  kennedy package  think with lily where linus has to make sure she always has a drink makes no sense in the context of her being pregnant are we really to believe that lily s logic was  i want to take the edge off but i ca nt drink so i m willing to pay  100 to make sure that i always have a non alcoholic drink in my hand   apparently stress makes her really dehydrated i know it s nit picky  but it feels like lazy writing like they really wanted the joke of lily always having a drink  so they did nt care that it made absolutely no sense 
5786,himym,the show is called how i met your mother a season after they met would have been against the whole point what the show really needed was about 20 minutes of ted grieving let her death sink in  and then bring back robin that would have solved all the issues 
5787,himym,the way they treated barney s character in the finale was probably the worst part for me they spent the whole show building up his arch and having him slowly stop being interested in the wild sleeping around ways but then they just dropped all of that instantly and had him go on a fuck spree  the finale pretty much abandoned all the character archs they had set up earlier 
5788,himym,i actually did nt mind how much the mother was in the show i think it was rather tastefully done the show was still how i met your mother  because meeting robin is what technically made barney and robin s relationship possible this in turn led to meeting the mother  that being said  i found the final three episodes a train wreck of highs and lows especially the ending 
5789,himym,as soon as the final episode ended  i cracked up i made a realization that  it s a <URL>  do nt get me wrong  since there was such a huge buildup about the mother  her appearance on the show was way less than i expected  i thought it was a great show  despite this i really enjoyed emotionally connecting to the characters  and it s really interesting how events in ted s life  seemingly unrelated to the eventual meeting of his wife  actually did relate  the fact that the show ended made me realize that  despite having an emotional connection to the characters and their story  it s over they are nt real  i   however   do  have a future  it was nice that this show was not so much  happy ever after  culturally  in the us  at least if you re brought up watching disney  etc   there s this idea of  happy every after  once you meet your spouse but that s unrealistic this show was so great because it showed how complex relationships are it s not just romanticsexual relationships  but how they relate to each other and how your friends and family fit in there s not necessarily  one   perfect  person out there or maybe we can say there is  but things do nt always work out the way you initially expect  and the fact that he gets back with robin is fitting  in my mind   they have all those great stories and memories together  and they get along  really well  as  friends  when and if i get married  i want my spouse to be my best friend  that s my two cents 
5790,himym,in all fairness the show is titled how i  met  your mother  not how i dated your mother i assume that the kids already know things about their mother s life and how their early relationship went  if not how they met he even says that they know the short version of the story it was  supposed  to end when they meet 
5791,himym,does she know about the  official alternate ending      <URL>  v  rohus<SMILE>j7x94 
5792,himym,one of us   
5793,himym,i really wish it would have showed somthing about how barney s daughter ended up or at least had a scene with the mother of his kid
5794,himym,sounds like you ve got a keeper 
5795,himym,maybe the mother was right for him at the time  like barney s short successful  marriage that ended maybe forever is too long to expect anything to last that another theme is that perfect moments  albeit short  are all we can really expect 
5796,himym,there was a fan edit a while back that was absolutely perfect same <URL>  but you walk away feeling a bit more comfortable with it  since the way it was cut really shows that ted and tracy had an amazing life together for a pretty long time  keep in mind the kids are in their teens and she s been gone for about 6 years   and that she would have wanted him to move on once that sting is out you really get to see the artistic vision behind the show it speaks a lot about fatedestiny  and a big part of the theme was always how what might be right for you at one point in your life  might not be right for you later on or viceversa  the shirt    in his 30 s40 s tracy was what he needed someone to start a family with and at that same time barney was what robin needed  someone to keep her company while she lived out her dream career but later on in life ted already having the kids  and them being mostly grown up  and robin being  well  robin they were what they needed then even his kids encourage him to go get her  but i m rambling  my point is  the video seems to have disappeared but i ll bet if you look hard enough you can find it it s much better and i m sure your gf would love it   ps  if you ca nt find it  i think i have it downloaded on my old computer let me know and if i can find it  i ll upload it to dropbox or something 
5797,himym, you re
5798,himym,the last season was embarrassingly bad 
5799,himym,rando i love it 
5800,himym,i ve been watching the show for the first time and i already know all about the finale of the show and the ending i do nt want that ending  is there a fan edit of the final episode with less divorce  fewer deaths  and no robin  ted 
5801,himym,i feel like people who do nt want to watch the original ending are just in denial 
5802,himym,the best i can give you is mine  that keeps the ending but makes it flow a lot better if you want the one that you re describing  you re going to have to wait for a few more weeks until i finish my new edited finale    <URL>
5803,himym,yes    <URL>  v  rohus<SMILE>j7x94
5804,himym,perfect 
5805,himym,this used to be my favorite show it was my background noise whenever i did nt have anything to watch  or do  i would put how i met your mother on and just let it play i loved the show  i loved the characters  i loved everything about it i can not count how many times i ve watched it through until the finale i m not arguing a side of how it should have ended it just left a bitter taste in my mouth i ve never had something like that happen before i have nt been able to bring myself to watch it since it ended because i just could nt believe how it all ended up and again  i m not arguing one way or the other  but the originally ending tarnished such a great feeling in my memory and it may be stupid to some  but some of you may understand on a personal level this ending just feels right  and i do nt think i would be bitter about it i do nt care that he ended up with robin i just feel cheated to have been given such an amazing perfect character to only have it all taken away in such a quick impersonal way and i guess that may be the point life cheats you  life does nt care how you ve invested yourself it goes on whether you like it or not but seeing this  for the first time btw  gave me those feelings i used to have for the show again maybe i can start over again and like it the way i used to wow i ve been ranting sorry about that 
5806,himym,i prefer the emotional roller coaster of the original ending this is too fairly tale 
5807,himym,way better than the blue french horn ending i m all for the yellow umbrella
5808,himym,i like this  but it makes a lot of scenes from the show meaningless  and also cuts out a lot of great scenes the ending we got was the ending we were always supposed to get  and i think it fits the show perfectly sure it could have been executed better  like giving barney and robin s marriage more time on the show  but otherwise i think it worked out great 
5809,himym,this still does nt make me happy i feel sad when i think about how robin is barley part of the group anymore  i need this fixed and then i will be okay 
5810,himym,why could nt we just have this    
5811,himym,this ending is so much better the original ending was just a slap in the face <SMILE> years of building up a character for nothing we already moved pass robin and ted they are nt for each other why force it  then the kids getting all perky and hyper right after their dad was talking about their dead mother  does nt fit the show at all title is  how i met your mother  not aunt whoever decided to use the original ending failed at their job makes me happy  how i met your dad  is nt going to happen hell they even screwed up the title on that one 
5812,himym,main issue from my point of view  is that show s title and season 9  which should nt have happened  but extended due to shows  popularity  raised audiences expectations about the mother we sympathized for the mother due to her frequent appearances in s9  if i accept this alternate ending as the true ending  then i would feel just terrible for robin from the beginning  creators wanted robin to end up with ted i spent <SMILE> years watching her getting along with the group instead  she ended up alone  regretting her decisions  cast aside  and prob live alone forever 
5813,himym,i have nt and will never watch the finale this show ends on the wedding day for me 
5814,himym,next time i watch himym all the way through  i m skipping the last 10 minutes of the finale and watching this
5815,himym,after rewatching the series  i  ve noticed  this picture     <URL>  is a screenshot from the season 4 premiere   do i know you    confirmed by <URL>  correct me if i  m wrong  but isn  t he saying  that would be delightful   in that picture  he  s not even being himself that whole scene as he  s trying to impress robin on a date that she doesn  t even know is a date 
5816,himym, i m not looking to problemsolve  i m just looking to listen 
5817,himym,so i sought out season 9 and realised that netflix had actually been doing me a favour all along 
5818,himym,but netflix does have all 9 seasons 
5819,himym,you  re not missing much  sometimes i think i  d rather have stopped after season <SMILE> and left it a mystery 
5820,himym,when it does come out just watch every episode except the finale  much more satisfying 
5821,himym,how come that robin that never had a long relationship got five dogs from different boyfriends  did they gave her the dogs on the third date  who does that  also  five times  i think that past the third one it gets weird that a new boyfriend would want to give her another i know that it is just an excuse to get rid of the dogs because josh s allergies but i m rewatching the series and this is bothering me so much
5822,himym,what can she say  mama gets swag  it was really lazy writing to further the plot of just one episode in the episode with her sister  s2e12  she says that she has never said  i love you  to a boyfriend because she has never been in a relationship for more than 6    months but then 4 episodes later apparently she has gotten 5 dogs from exes the plot hole with barney and driving was also season 2  in e17 he ca nt drive  in e1<SMILE> he steals ted s truck   i wouldnt been totally surprised if carter and craig were just trolling us 
5823,himym,what s makes no sense to me is that she has 5 dogs in a tiny new york apartment  that s bordering on animal cruelty besides that she works crazy hours  lives alone and spends all here spare time at ted and marshall s apartment or in the bar how does she take care of 5 dogs   how does she pay for 5 dogs   when is she walking these 5 dogs   why ca nt she just have one dog  why not 5 guinea pigs  it s so crazy  and makes absolutely no sense 
5824,himym,i assumed the first bf pulled a  classic schmosby  and gave her a dog a couple months into the relationship to show he is serious but in turn ended the relationship because robin ca nt commit the other 4 bfs did nt want to be outdone by the previous so they gave her a dog even earlier than the other ones  robin did nt tell ted this until he asked because she finally learned that if she did ted would get her something super crazy considering he already dropped the i love you bomb on their first night  stole a blue french horn  asked her out with a blue string quartet  and made it rain for her before they even went out 
5825,himym,she also got at least another five dogs after that because the dogs in the finale are not the same as before
5826,himym,ted s telling the story and he s an unreliable narrator  
5827,himym,yeah it was stupid unless she brought some of the dogs from canada 
5828,himym,punching is not acceptable or funny no one should ever punch anyone else 
5829,himym,its a christmas record and i ve been trying to find out what its called for a few years
5830,himym,a perfect christmas performed by vasco amp  jerry abbot
5831,himym,i totally get what you mean i see the barney grin 
5832,himym,okay  so i m 100  sure i m  obviously  not the only one who s noticed this  but i thought i d share something funny i noticed  season 9 episode 12   the rehearsal dinner  the gang is sitting at the bar  cracking jokes about what weddings would be like in canada after a few cracks  robin states   two mitten jokes in a rowso you re pretty much done now  to which ted narrates   kids  we were nt even close  now  watch the background when the jokes continue to emphasize just how long their jokes go on  there s a whole story that unfolds for a family behind them it s the same people in the background throughout the little scene  just a funny thing i noticed  did anyone else catch it 
5833,himym,yup  i miss 2014 
5834,himym,yesh 
5835,himym,yes this has been caught hundreds and hundreds of times it literally gets posted here at least once a week 
5836,himym,that would nt have made any sense with the concept of the show  its the story of how ted   met   tm the kids already know about the life they lived as a family they were there  the few days leading up to the moment they met is the key  and focusing so much on that weekend  the near misses  and finally the meeting at the train station makes more sense for the concept of ted telling the story 
5837,himym,as soon as the the divorce happens everyone would know exactly how it will end so there would nt be any impact
5838,himym,i actually liked the format of it all being the wedding  because it made the finale more surprising and unpredictable and almost served as an epilogue showing the next 1<SMILE> years however  i would keep barney and robin together and not have tracy die there are some scenes i would add in  2 weeks after the wedding  ted and robin  now both in love with other people  share their last cigarette ever on the central park carousel and finally get over each other  subsequently failing to put the cigarette out properly and literally burning the symbol of their second thoughts for each other to the ground it also coincides with both the dates ted mentioned in  last cigarette ever   as robin  s is in june 2013 and ted  s is 2 weeks into dating tracy finally  it explains why they put up the no smoking on the carousel sign in  disaster averted   also  tell us how robin became a bull fighter goddamnit 
5839,himym,just finished the series last night the death just happens so fast i felt cheated wish they d given her at least a season of just being with the gang before pulling that stunt  and i did nt like the format of constantly jumping back and forth in time during barney s wedding 
5840,himym,i love the random asian kid taking notes in the class 
5841,himym,ted has to teach barney about robin because barney is not interested in finding these things out for himself  even at the end robin is more impressed with ted for knowing and remembering all these things about her
5842,himym,punching is not acceptable or funny no one should ever punch anyone else 
5843,himym,when ted tells stella they ll go to a wedding like 6 months in advance should be last half of season 3
5844,himym,that would nt have made any sense with the concept of the show  its the story of how ted   met   tm the kids already know about the life they lived as a family they were there  the few days leading up to the moment they met is the key  and focusing so much on that weekend  the near misses  and finally the meeting at the train station makes more sense for the concept of ted telling the story 
5845,himym,as soon as the the divorce happens everyone would know exactly how it will end so there would nt be any impact
5846,himym,i actually liked the format of it all being the wedding  because it made the finale more surprising and unpredictable and almost served as an epilogue showing the next 1<SMILE> years however  i would keep barney and robin together and not have tracy die there are some scenes i would add in  2 weeks after the wedding  ted and robin  now both in love with other people  share their last cigarette ever on the central park carousel and finally get over each other  subsequently failing to put the cigarette out properly and literally burning the symbol of their second thoughts for each other to the ground it also coincides with both the dates ted mentioned in  last cigarette ever   as robin  s is in june 2013 and ted  s is 2 weeks into dating tracy finally  it explains why they put up the no smoking on the carousel sign in  disaster averted   also  tell us how robin became a bull fighter goddamnit

5848,himym,february 2nd at 1  0<SMILE>am central my daughter was born into this world unfortunately since the mother and i are nt on good terms at all i was nt allowed to attend here i am two days later and i finally got to meet my daughter facetoface and just as barney suspected he would act in season 9 episode 24  i thought i would nt feel different at all and that i would be a cold soul about it all  practically disregarding the fact that i even had a daughter  the second i laid my eyes on her i took hold of her and the only thing i could manage to tell her was  you are the love of my life everything i have and everything i am is yours forever   himym foreshadowed how i would react to meeting my daughter down to the teary hug i had with her after i told her 
5849,himym,congrats  you re going to love that girl so much 
5850,himym,congratulations 
5851,himym,her name better be wait for it
5852,himym,congrats  let us know if you need a shotgun or help beating up some dudes in 13 years 
5853,himym,congratulations  i hope everything works out amicably with the mother 
5854,himym,i remember those feelings 
5855,himym,mazel tov 
5856,himym,wow  got a little attention  i figured it would seep through the cracks thanks everyone for your kind words of sincerity  
5857,himym,no matter what kind of relationship you have with her mother  be a freaking awesome dad for her
5858,himym,my ideal season 9 would ve been the finale  just stretched over 24 episodes  i think it should have been flashbacks to the wedding over the 17 years that the finale covered then the divorce would ve been a good mid season finale  and we would have been able to enjoy some of the better moments of the finale and probably had better closure with tm s death 
5859,himym,barney tells ted a rule where you never create plans for the future with your girlfriend if the plan is further away than the time you ve known each other 
5860,himym,i really did nt like this episode
5861,himym,you might be thinking of s1 ep 3 where they lick the liberty bell barney said something along the lines of   because you re my best friend ok you do nt have to tell me i m yours  this is from memory though so i could be wrong  but that s what i remember 
5862,himym,barney tells ted a rule where you never create plans for the future with your girlfriend if the plan is further away than the time you ve known each other 
5863,himym,in the episode where ted is visited by future copies of himself and barney to try to talk him into robots v wrestlers  what s the point of this episode  i ve seen it at least 10 times and all i gather from it is that it s unnecessarily sad for no reason 
5864,himym,this is my favorite episode it s just meant to make you sad and realize how ted s life is the only one not going anywhere and it s a lot more poignant once you see the ending of the series 
5865,himym,what brought me the most comfort was a pic saying  for 9 years we dreamed of true loveonly to have our happy ending ripped away from us so soon after we got it   ted  standing in the rain  just like this guy  that s paraphrased  but maybe the sentiment will help her as well
5866,himym,in episode 11 of season 1  robin and ted kiss at midnight on new years  eve the song playing in the background  la vie en rose 
5867,himym,this has actually been posted before and proven that it actually is nt la vie en rose it sounds very similar but the melody is nt the same 
5868,himym,oh it really is    that s great foreshadowing
5869,himym,i have not noticed that before  thanks
5870,himym,i do nt get it what s the significance of the song 
5871,himym,i think someone stated that here earlier
5872,himym,holy fucking shit that s fucking insane dude holy fucking shit                              i m losing my fucking mind over this     whoa     whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

5880,himym,marshall ted barney robin lily
5881,himym,1 marshall 2 barney 3 lilly 4 ted 5 robin
5882,himym,1 ted 2 marshall 3 barney 4 robin 5 lily i identify too much with ted to not have him at number one  marshall and barney would be flipped if the show had only ran for up to four seasons  it hurts putting robin so far down but it is what it is  lily is always last sorry lily 
5883,himym,ted  robin  lily  marshall  barney
5884,himym,1  ted 2  marshall 3  barney 4  robin 5  the mom and i do nt like lily so i do nt rank her
5885,himym,marshall tracey lily robin ted pile of soot barney
5886,himym,ted barney robin marsh and lils are basically 1 person so they get equal rank
5887,himym,1 marshall  he s basically me irl  just with a hot wife  2 barney 3 ted 4 lily 5 robin
5888,himym,i was rewatching the slap bet episode and i noticed something that really bugged me when marshall slapped barney prematurely and was wrong barney got two slaps on marshall but then when barney did the same thing to marshall lily made him choose between ten slaps immediately or five at any time  thats absurdly biased by lily and not at all fair the slap bet commissioner is supposed to be impartial 
5889,himym,to be fair swarley slapped marshall three times  while marshal had only slapped swarely once  so if we say  every time one of them slaps the other prematurely they get two additional slaps  then after swarely slapped marshal 3 times that s 6 slaps  plus the one for winning the bet  so 7  this presents lily with a rounding issue  because who wants to give out 7 slaps  10 right away or 5 across slapternity seems about equal  and 7 is in the middle 5 and 10  roughly  so it seems fair
5890,himym,did nt barney have to agree to lily s being named sbc  once all parties agree on the sbc  all rulings <URL>  fair  he had every reason to expect that she would favor marshall over him  and to know that he was nt exactly her favorite person  tho  of course  this is the same guy who insists that he is ted s best friend  so 
5891,himym,to be honest  it was dumb for barney to even agree for lily to be the sbc  there s no way she was going to be impartial however  lily should have done a better job and this is on my list of reasons why i dislike lily 
5892,himym,   lesbian robin   is the masculine version of robin that her father desired a part of robin likely wishes she could have remained masculine     mustache marshall   is not only a lawyer but grows a sick mustache that marshall can never grow and for 2002 marshall who is nt even in law school yet  this is very desirable     stripper lily   represents the part of lily who wants to embrace her slutty side and not have to worry about being a mom or being responsible and instead just cuts loose     mexican wrestler ted   is this macho cool version of ted who his friends adore because he does nt go on long rants and he fights robots     fertility specialist barney   gets to look at women s vagina s all day 
5893,himym,fertility clinic barney respects women and builds families barney wants to stop sleeping around  but he ca nt because he s insecure and does nt think he can hold a relationship 
5894,himym,for what it s worth  i had always thought one thing about tracy should have been a dopplegaenger of her own  to ensure her place in the selfstyled awesome group  since that did nt happen  i ll set up a reason in terms of this thread  tracy had no need of a dopplegaenger because she was fully comfortable with how she expressed herself 
5895,himym,just when i thought i knew all the quirks of the show 
5896,himym,  glass shatters  
5897,himym,you should put this on rfantheories
5898,himym,gt  who his friends adore because he does nt go on long rants and he fights robots  though to be fair  it s mostly the robots thing by itself 
5899,himym,but what about that chick in the group of chicks that looks like marshall 
5900,himym,that s a great observation
5901,himym,wow  this is amazing 
5902,himym,this is a great observation and makes me appreciate the show even more i m betting that this post will show up on yahoo news in the next couple of days 
5903,himym,never thought about it like this  incredible observation 
5904,himym,so cab driver barney was nt a real doppelganger  but question on that front  when did barney learn to drive  there was a whole episode on how he could nt drive and how terrified he was trying to learn 
5905,himym,yess  i think i picked up on this but had forgotten to actually think about it deeper also uender<SMILE>9 is amazingly spot on  ugh i love this show just got done watching it over for the second time  but to be fair i started when most of the seasons had nt come out yet so it was a lot of waiting  i wan na watch it again now  
5906,himym,tweet this to the creators  
5907,himym,in another world when lilly did nt date marshall or he died early on i m betting she s a major slut like a female barney who i m sure she slept with a few times maybe even robin probably ted  wow think for a second how much that would change the show
5908,himym,holy fuck dude  nice catch 
5909,himym,robin still is masculine
5910,himym,maybe i did not discover the america but  while i was drawing today i realized that ted and is beloved  dead    wife had basically the same experience  both found the love of their life  but they died  and then they find someone else who s comparable to that love but not quite so but maybe more appropriate  just a fresh thought  maybe someone already noticed it just wanted to share this with all of you 
5911,himym,so you are saying ted was nt tracy s the one  i disagree 
5912,himym,your fresh thought makes me sad 
5913,himym,i said to my girlfriend yesterday that tracy never disconnected from her boyfriend after he died her boyfriend allowed her to be with ted  but ultimately  she died and went to be with him as ted was destined to be with robin forever 
5914,himym,somebody on this sub a while back distinguished between  soulmate  and  love of life   and i think the distinction actually makes a lot of sense for the show  soulmate  means the one whom a character is most naturally matched for and drawn to  and for whom chemistry and timing both line up however  it is nt necessarily who that person spends their life with  usually because of circumstances out of their control  but sometimes because of the relationship itself    love of one s life  indicates the person that they may not be the most naturally matched for  but whom they are matched for  drawn to  and end up with ultimately and it applies to all the main characters in different ways  it should also be specified that these categories do nt necessarily imply romance   marshall and lily are both soulmates and the love of each other s lives they connect from the instant that they meet and do nt really ever let go of each other  barney s soulmate is robin  and robin s soulmate is barney but their natural chemistry  timing  and love for each other ca nt get them past themselves and their own careers  and they get divorced but barney s love of his life ends up being his daughter  ellie  whom he greets as the  love of his life  the very moment he first meets her and robin s love of her life ends up being ted  with whom she always had chemistry  but the wrong timing  tracy s soulmate is max  but he is taken from her by an early death she ends up with ted  whom she calls the  love of her life  in the show and who is with her to the very end  finally  and most important to the show overall  ted s soulmate is tracy  but she is taken from him by illness but the love of his life is robin  whom he knew for years and always felt drawn to  but without the right timing ted s telling of the story of how he met tracy occurs at the moment when chemistry finally meets timing for robin and ted  and when his kids give him their blessing to start dating again 
5915,himym,it s much like love in the time of cholera by pablo neruda in this way 
5916,himym,barney tells ted a rule where you never create plans for the future with your girlfriend if the plan is further away than the time you ve known each other 
5917,himym,when ted tells stella they ll go to a wedding like 6 months in advance should be last half of season 3
5918,himym,i just binged watched it twice and ted and lily are horrible people  robin is okay at time and so is marshall but he can get annoying as well 
5919,himym,i never got this i see people whine about how ted was  just  the straight man  or how lily was a bitch troughout the entire series bullshit  barney and marshall were better characters than ted for sure  but ted made me laugh the most the mosby boys  when he gets cocky  when he lets barney drag him along and plays ball  man those moments were so good he is a hopeless romantic  so what  everyone deserves to find  the one   he is most definitely not boring and yeah  how lily stole christmas was a horrible episode  aldrin justice is a flawed system as ted pointed out and lily had no right to break up ted s relationships  but other than those three situations  you d have to  really  do something wrong to actually dislike or even hate one of the characters 
5920,himym,to me  barney was a sociopath  i do nt get why people were rooting for him  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  it was  shelter island  that began my loathing of barney stinson he circled  get her drunk  and  emotionally vulnerable  on a whiteboard  as part of an elaborate  premeditated scheme to have sex with robin  regardless of her wishes there s a word for that  rapist  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  i offer  sandcastles in the sand  as further evidence robin was in a vulnerable state barney and robin lingered at the bar we saw robin drinking  probably scotch  the whole time and she had a headstart on barney he arrived late if barney had waited  even a few hours  till robin was stonecold sober and less heartbroken  would robin have consented to a tryst with barney  we know from  the goat  that robin was embarrassed and remorseful the next day whatever feelings barney might have had  it was his duty  as a friend  to resist barney took advantage of robin  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  compare this to  doppelgangers  in which robin was again heartbroken and vulnerable ted warns robin that he and she are drunk and he then seems hesitant when she leans forward yes  it was lucky for ted that his awesome hair broke the spell  he was pulling it off   but future ted notes that a relapse with robin that night would have been a terrible mistake by contrast  back in  the goat  we saw barney collecting  bpegs  for his mental harddrive he had no regret he said so ted is human and nearly stumbled  he was relieved that nothing happened without remorse  barney consciously set out to recreate  sandcastles in the sand  with his  shelter island  schemeamp  nbsp   utterly despicable  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  at this point  barney supporters try to tell me that he changed  over the years no his proposal was like the recruitment strategy for a cult the recruit is kept disoriented  under stress  for several weeks and then thrown a lifeline  which the recruit instinctively grabs once indoctrinated  a cult member never looks back to question the process it is the writers  not me  who chose a hannibal lecter metaphor by having robin put herself in a pit over barney  a  silence of the lambs  reference  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  amp  nbsp  in the eighth season  barney makes a big show of destroying the play book but that was a lie not only does he own a  hoebegone   he used it on robin even robin acknowledges that barney s entire courtship was built on lies it was not until the secondtolast episode that barney finally   finally  promises to be truthful with robin that is not consistent character growth that is too little  too late 
5921,himym,consider this  if they were nt flawed characters  the show would nt have anything funny about it perfect people are nt that interesting to watch  definitely not in a comedy 
5922,himym,why do i love every character except barney 
5923,himym,people like you are the reason we got a shitty last season and a terrible finale
5924,himym,i agree with you op i just started watching himym last week and i ca nt stand ted  lilly and sometimes marshall  ted is just a massive pseudointellectual douche he s so mean to people  ca nt make mature decisions and when he likes a girl he just falls crazy in love and ca nt take no for an answer  it s not realistic at all especially when he does some bad things to his partners  especially robin  yet it s okay because he was reacting to something they did which is complete bs  lilly also pisses me off because she thinks she s always right and dishing out justice for the group based on some sick moral compass she does some pretty horrible things to ted too  like the episode where she calls him to ditch his date  to change her tyre in the middle of nowhere and then leave him then not call and expect everything to go back to normal and she bloody hits barney a lot  ftm violence is just as bad  i do nt care if people find it funnynot that i can see how she also ca nt keep secrets  ruins relationships and is a terrible person  just like ted is to some girls  robin and marshall are okay but not as bad now barney definitely does douchey things constantly  but i feel for him because he s the odd one out in the group always getting picked on  and i think we can only pity him because we know his sense of confidence is exaggerated and artificial based on some deeper issues in his past that he has nt dealt with and his fragile emotions  so that s why ted  lilly  evil and barney  awesome 
5925,himym,it s in hd  so it s a pretty big file  i ll upload a lower quality version later edit   here s one   kinda   still hd file     <URL>  202mp4  dl  0   this one s about 1gb standard definition version  here     <URL>  20sdmp4  dl  0  edit edit  since the dropbox files are having some issues  i made a torrent file   link     <URL>  usp  sharing  i m also going to see if there s another way for me to upload it as well    edit edit edit  if someone still wants to see it  send me a pm and i ll hook you up  
5926,himym,be sure to cross post this to rfanedits 
5927,himym,so the definitive how i met your mother episode  haha
5928,himym,i m working on a similar project  but keeping the episode format  removing daphne  and some other annoyances hopefully i ll have a few episodes available soon  op  shoot me a message i have nt seen your movie yet  but i d love to talk about your thoughts and tools you used 
5929,himym,just finished watching great job on this the pacing felt like it had momentum
5930,himym,thanks  i ve been meaning to do a rewatch  but do nt want to deal with season 9 again  
5931,himym,good point false alarm needed to open in chrome using bacon reader at the moment
5932,himym,i really enjoyed it did you ever consider just using the exit from the  alternate ending     youtuberohus<SMILE>j7x94  t  3m21s   but this was a lot of fun 
5933,himym,i m posting late but i want to say thanks i found the finale retroactively ruined the show for me but my boyfriend is forcing me to watch it through once more  even season 9 he s willing to skip s9 if we watch this instead  and we re both happy that you changed the ending  so thankyou 
5934,himym,super cool  thanks 
5935,himym,sweet nice 
5936,himym,file missing edit  false alarm bacon reader fail 
5937,himym,did nt have time to watch the whole thing  just watched the end to make sure it did nt suck thank you for this  this is what i ll tell people to watch from now on instead of the full season 9 shitshow 
5938,himym,i ca nt get it on mobile 
5939,himym,great job  i have to praise how you handled the episode s transitions and the pacing in general i know there was a lot to cut out  but you managed to keep it pretty coherent  now for a bit of criticism  which may be very subjective so take it with a grain of salt  1 you said that daphne is hard to cut out  which i agree  but i think there were a couple of unnecessary scenes on the final cut  like the ones with clint and daphne s daughter  which makes her appear for half the film i know that it s there to teach marshall to stand up for himself  but i feel like he already learned that lesson when he decided to take the job without telling lily  2 after all that build up of marshall and lily s arc  it s kind of disappointing that it resolves so fast  or maybe i just really like the discussion marshall has with ghost lily  the one about keeping score   3 very minor things  when jeanette drops the locket there s a brief scene of young ted losing his balloon which does nt make much sense without context or when barney says that vengeance will soon be his and it s never explained what s he is talking about  his job   but this one i understand that you ca nt cut him midsentence  4 i m sad that the short scene where  barney finally passes the torch     <URL>  v  gdckmrns  did nt make it or gary blauman s last scene  5 given how you decided to end the story  the official alternate ending narration would have worked much better imo  6 i almost forgot  you showed how everyone met tracy  except barney i feel like you should have squeezed that somewhere 
5940,himym,i really enjoyed watching this thanks 
5941,himym,i ca nt open this dropbox file too much traffic on your account could you post it somewhere else 
5942,himym,really enjoyed watching this  and a much more satisfying ending compared to the original in my opinion great job thanks
5943,himym,remindme  7 days
5944,himym,i am not able to access the file  any way i could watch it 
5945,himym,no subtitle file 
5946,himym, is orange juice ok    no  
5947,himym,i love that episode the scene where he s talking to his dad about how no one really knows where they re going in life  all you can do is just hope for the best awesome 
5948,himym, oh my god  you have super mario kart   
5949,himym,i ve never seen the desire to cut off the crust
5950,himym,which episode is this
5951,himym,for me  the best part of the episode is when marshall is like   lily does nt know i m high  and lily s like   you re high   that face she makes with the voice she uses  hysterical 
5952,himym,it s a sign  bro
5953,himym,this episode is so accurate
5954,himym,which episode is this 
5955,himym,seriously one of the best episodes 
5956,himym,probably one of my top 5 favorite episodes 
5957,himym,rewatching everything again and up to season 7 there was an episode where they showed marshal and lily having bets about their friends  lives  they had a bet about robin and ted never being together  and they had many chances to pay up and they never could  at the end marshal said  not yet  
5958,himym,unless ted and robin broke up a few weeks after the finale 
5959,himym,yes  if you watch the table read for the last episode on youtube  at the end marshal is singing a song and lily has to pay up for some reason they did nt show that in the show 
5960,himym,yes he did  lily paid him the money in the deleted scene
5961,himym,i think marshall pays lily when tracy takes a picture of the gang before ted and tracy s wedding but unfortunately  marshall had won the bet so i guess post finale  lily should have paid him back 
5962,himym,marshall pays lily during the alternate ending
5963,himym,what if marshall poisoned tracy so that ted could be open to fall in love again in a few years in order to win his bet with lily  
5964,himym,yeah  it was after that episode that i knew definitively that they would end up together  and i started theorizing that the mother would likely die
5965,himym,plays vanessa in deadpool and is crazy hot and crazy 
5966,himym,well she has done a couple of great things over the last 15 years firefly  v  homeland  gotham not really a new face around here 
5967,himym,crazy eyes 
5968,himym,dude it hit me during the sex scene that she was crazy eyes freaked me out from there on
5969,himym,that fucker s smirk though 
5970,himym,this is a really nice gif
5971,himym,which episode is this from 
5972,himym,me too thanks
5973,himym,it s especially funny when you remember the apartment is smaller than what s shown in the show because it s bigger in his memories 
5974,himym,she took a buzzfeed quiz asking which season the episode was from based on lily s hair and went 09  source     <URL> 
5975,himym,that s because she lived it  ulomats7 that s because she lived the how ted met their mother 
5976,himym,what a grinch 
5977,himym,not unusual in the business  many actors avoid watching themselves 
5978,himym,in season 7 episode 4  1 of barney s plays is that he is a gay hairdresser picking up chicks for his straight brother  so during that scene  we have a gay guy playing a straight guy pretending to be a gay guy to pick up chicks for said straight guy  i ve had some vodka tonight  by the way 
5979,himym,it s actually weekend at barneys if i m correct 
5980,himym,huh definitely a strange connection i do nt think they re purposefully done that way but who knows  hey  when you think about it in harold and kumar  nph is a gay man playing a straight man pretending to be a gay man so he can pick up chicks nph is the only man with more game than barney stinson  edit  went to put in a comma  fucked up the whole thing some how too high  way too late think i m going to sleep now  edit2  inb4 username checks out
5981,himym,do nt you mean he s an alive guy pretending to be an alive guy pretending to be a dead guy  it s nph pretending to be barney pretending to be dead barney
5982,himym,i looks like a  white atlanta thrashers jersey     <URL>  minus all logos and numbers
5983,himym,rhockeyjerseys can help you out
5984,himym,pulling them off 
5985,himym, regarding the other two comments     youtubecxk_na2ivxw 
5986,himym,this is my favorite ted scene   d
5987,himym,definitely one of my favorite episodes
5988,himym,fuck this show in its entirety 
5989,himym,1 dont put the punch line in the title 2 dont post from shows that are not funny
5990,himym,i was catching an old episode of himym and it was the wedding episode back from season 1  ted and victoria vow not to kiss or hook up at the wedding but teddy westside decides to look for buttercup up and down the city  at the end of the episode he founds her and they have their first kiss  it was an amazing moment and no disrespect to the couples that followed but this was the perfect first kiss and this shows best  what do you think is the shows best kiss 
5991,himym,ted and robin on the roofthere is no off switch
5992,himym,that episode in general was really cute always good on rewatch even though it s high on the schmaltz
5993,himym,ted and robin in season 1 finale after he made it rain for her
5994,himym,what the heck  cindy and the beautiful girl 
5995,himym,the kiss and the  thank god   moment when ted finds victoria in season 1 
5996,himym,best kiss is lilly and marshal at the airport when he brings the marching band
5997,himym,ted and tm s first kiss

6040,mylittlepony,i ve heard a lot of folks talking about the various aus from the season 5 finale  but most seem to focus on the crystal war i think we re overlooking a  huge  one  though the nightmare moon timeline  so  here s the aus we see in the episode   crystal war timelineponies locked in an endless civil war  changeling timelineponies driven to the brink of extinction    by changelings  nightmare timelinewe ll get to this in a minute  tirek timelineget rekt  equestria  discord timelinediscord ruins everything  flim and flam timelineget rekt  again   equestria  apocalypse timelineequestria done got rekt in contrast to all of the above  the nightmare timeline seems rather stable rarity tells twilight that the castle is closed to toursimplying that ponies have both the leisure time and disposable <URL> to go travelling further  nightmare moon says that celestia has been trapped for  years  thus  whatever changes she s had to make to the status quo  equestria has apparently been pretty stable  both rarity and rainbow dash are mean to twilight  but this could be due to the circumstancessomeone claiming to be a princess has charged into the literal royal palace  after visiting hours are over  their brusqueness is  at least  understandable  same goes for nightmare moon s obsessive desire to hoard magic  in addition to her inborn jealousy  she was banished for 1000 years using powerful magic  it s would be natural for her to want to keep  powerful  magic out of the hooves of the common people  so  friendship is replaced by fascism  but otherwise  not much has apparently changed personally  i find this au the most interesting of the seven presented  and i would love to see a little more of it  in fanfic  etc

6070,mylittlepony,   abbored  me and my friend went to mcdonald s today to pick up some of the toys well  specifically   he  got the toy  i just tagged along because i felt like going on an adventure     abmehr  he got the happy meal  and specifically asked for the pony  and the lady swapped the pony for the transformer he had to go back up to the counter and ask them to swap it  he got rainbow dash  after the fuss  and her hair kind of looks like ketchup and mustard      <URL> 
6071,mylittlepony,for my friends hunting for these things  they get new ones every 5 days here  s the wave list  wave 1 pinkie pie  1 rainbow dash  2 wave 2 fluttershy  3 suri polomarebuttonbelle  4 wave 3 princess twilight  5 coco pommelmiss pommel  6 wave 4  final wave  rarity  7 starlight glimmer  <SMILE> and a few reminders  ask by number  not by color or name reason  there are 4 pink ones  and 2 yellow ones yeah  i know  twilight is nt pink  but with mcdonald s store lighting she looks like it rainbow dash and rarity are fair game  though and unless they watch the show  they wo nt know what pony you re referring to if you ask by name  if you re not into mcdonald s food  you can get the toy without the meal sometimes it s free  and sometimes it s a dollar it varies on the mcdonalds  and also  if there is a pony you want but they are nt in the wave the store is currently in  go to different mcdonald s sometimes they screw up and get a wave before they re supposed to get it call the store and ask by number  and lastly  the customer satisfaction box for those who do nt know  the customer satisfaction box is a box where you get all the ponies in one go only corporate stores get em   so call around very early in the promotion and see if they have them in stock and remember  the store only gets one so call reaaaallly early happy hunting   copied from my eqd comment

6150,mylittlepony,when was trixie redeemed  and when did she fall  also  should nt the fruit bats be considered redeemed  since they ended up serving a useful purpose  rather than a destructive one 
6151,mylittlepony,awesome 
6152,mylittlepony,i object to angel being considered an antagonist 
6153,mylittlepony,does the f stand for friendshipfatality 
6154,mylittlepony,a few thoughts  silver spoon was nt redeemed  she just went solo  iron will is nt an antagonist fluttershy s challenge was with herself  flutterbat was nt an antagonist either she was a plot device 
6155,mylittlepony,it d be interesting to see how this chart changes if you include the comics 
6156,mylittlepony,   cocosad  what has coco done to deserve being called an antagonist 
6157,mylittlepony,   twismile  this project ended up being a lot more subjective than i originally thought when i started it there were a bunch of times i was on the fence about a certain character or situation  does that constitute a defeat     was that a humiliation  or is it just humiliating because defeat is humiliating   i decided not to include the mane 6 or cmc because that would be just opening up a can of worms of complications exceptions being where they were not in their right mind  transformed  possessed  etc   i also did nt include the comics continuity  as that would really complicate things  also i have nt read all of them    sp     twiponder  diamond tiara was especially tricky  not only because she s so often an antagonist but because a lot of the time she does nt even really have any goals besides being a jerk to the cmc there were times she was humiliated where karma sought to make her fall her face or something  but not really defeated because she did nt have any plans or goals to defeat oddly enough  the number of defeats and humiliations came out the same    sp     twisecret  keep in mind that the way i m using  antagonist  here does nt necessarily mean  villain   for example  i included tree hugger because discord is the protagonist of  make friends but keep discord   and she  mostly without even knowing it  is his rival and standing in the way of his goals

6204,mylittlepony,she s taken everything from her channel down except this   <URL>  v  v7kpdatfxjc who would do such a thing to her 
6205,mylittlepony,i m guessing someone said something that hurt her i know how that feels if i was in her situation  i probably would nt come back to youtube  either i ve never really heard of pinkie rose before  but she sounds like a talented person i hope she makes the right decision with all of this  edit  i now realize this is a bigger situation than mean comments i apologize for making the situation seem less important than it is i hope she s alright 
6206,mylittlepony,i do nt know who this is and what kind of content they created  besides voice acting as she said   but what happened  god damn 
6207,mylittlepony,   fluttershh  i love pinkie rose  she made a lot of great videos and while i am sad that she quit the fandom why did she delete the videos  so many people liked them 
6208,mylittlepony,i have links to some of her videos saved luckily  she did nt delete everything everything s just been set to private still  i hope everything turns out ok 
6209,mylittlepony, i should probrably not get sucked into this but i ll just go for it anyway and see what happens no regrets yet  it s really a shame when people throw out all of there work  and leave no evidence or context of what happened  i know she is hurt  but i know idea why we can sit hear and get all emotional about it  or move on because she s cut down her lines of communication down to one last video and what is now possibly a dead channel  all in all there is nothing to see here or do  for all who think i m being a jerk ok sure  i d say she is already long gone and will never come back  she already cause this much selfdestruction  her best option is really not to come back and just have fun doing something else  she sounds young and not mature enough to handle the demands of her audience 13ksubs like that can be alot of pressure the demands she could have made for herself and the regular online nasty that comes with ever increasing exposure  what she really needs is a good talking to which does nt seem possible anymore unless she steps forward  begging her to come back wo nt make things better it makes things complicated and it s not good for what seems to me a formative experience  and op ugreninjasheik1 gt  who would do such a thing to her  really  tier 1 shit concerns  it actually does nt matter anymore  nor should we care who or what kind of person did whatever they did  what matter is how to help  secondly it sounds like from what she said  i ve done some things i ve said some things  that she is taking some fault and responsiblity of something or anything and with  they ve been circling around  it also seems like her trust has been betrayed  chances are she connected her youtube channel and twitter account too close to her personal life and has reaped the consequences of having such a set up for convenience  something that kids would do without thinking too much into it  actually with all this said i realize that i m wasting my time  gg game over she is nt coming back  why should we care like really   nobody can help other than spam her with consolation to her now dead channel     discordgrump     walkingabout  i m out
6210,mylittlepony,i hope that there s a way to turn this around i ca nt bear to see people in trouble 
6211,mylittlepony,i do nt even know who this is and i feel sad    i hate to imagine what upset her so much  any idea what happened 
6212,mylittlepony,who is pinkie rose  and what exactly did she do  and why did she leave

6241,mylittlepony,i wan na see more  sombra takes over twilight  stuff  there s not a lot of that and a lot  can  be done with that 
6242,mylittlepony,i ve heard a lot of folks talking about the various aus from the season 5 finale  but most seem to focus on the crystal war i think we re overlooking a  huge  one  though the nightmare moon timeline  so  here s the aus we see in the episode   crystal war timelineponies locked in an endless civil war  changeling timelineponies driven to the brink of extinction    by changelings  nightmare timelinewe ll get to this in a minute  tirek timelineget rekt  equestria  discord timelinediscord ruins everything  flim and flam timelineget rekt  again   equestria  apocalypse timelineequestria done got rekt in contrast to all of the above  the nightmare timeline seems rather stable rarity tells twilight that the castle is closed to toursimplying that ponies have both the leisure time and disposable <URL> to go travelling further  nightmare moon says that celestia has been trapped for  years  thus  whatever changes she s had to make to the status quo  equestria has apparently been pretty stable  both rarity and rainbow dash are mean to twilight  but this could be due to the circumstancessomeone claiming to be a princess has charged into the literal royal palace  after visiting hours are over  their brusqueness is  at least  understandable  same goes for nightmare moon s obsessive desire to hoard magic  in addition to her inborn jealousy  she was banished for 1000 years using powerful magic  it s would be natural for her to want to keep  powerful  magic out of the hooves of the common people  so  friendship is replaced by fascism  but otherwise  not much has apparently changed personally  i find this au the most interesting of the seven presented  and i would love to see a little more of it  in fanfic  etc 
6243,mylittlepony,i ll agree with that most people seem to have gone with the idea that everypony would be dead  but i ve not agreed with that given the world involved  maybe now someone ll pick up on the idea  i might  but i ve got something else going on at the moment later perhaps

6531,mylittlepony,i ve heard a lot of folks talking about the various aus from the season 5 finale  but most seem to focus on the crystal war i think we re overlooking a  huge  one  though the nightmare moon timeline  so  here s the aus we see in the episode   crystal war timelineponies locked in an endless civil war  changeling timelineponies driven to the brink of extinction    by changelings  nightmare timelinewe ll get to this in a minute  tirek timelineget rekt  equestria  discord timelinediscord ruins everything  flim and flam timelineget rekt  again   equestria  apocalypse timelineequestria done got rekt in contrast to all of the above  the nightmare timeline seems rather stable rarity tells twilight that the castle is closed to toursimplying that ponies have both the leisure time and disposable <URL> to go travelling further  nightmare moon says that celestia has been trapped for  years  thus  whatever changes she s had to make to the status quo  equestria has apparently been pretty stable  both rarity and rainbow dash are mean to twilight  but this could be due to the circumstancessomeone claiming to be a princess has charged into the literal royal palace  after visiting hours are over  their brusqueness is  at least  understandable  same goes for nightmare moon s obsessive desire to hoard magic  in addition to her inborn jealousy  she was banished for 1000 years using powerful magic  it s would be natural for her to want to keep  powerful  magic out of the hooves of the common people  so  friendship is replaced by fascism  but otherwise  not much has apparently changed personally  i find this au the most interesting of the seven presented  and i would love to see a little more of it  in fanfic  etc 
6532,mylittlepony,i ll agree with that most people seem to have gone with the idea that everypony would be dead  but i ve not agreed with that given the world involved  maybe now someone ll pick up on the idea  i might  but i ve got something else going on at the moment later perhaps 
6533,mylittlepony,   twismile  this project ended up being a lot more subjective than i originally thought when i started it there were a bunch of times i was on the fence about a certain character or situation  does that constitute a defeat     was that a humiliation  or is it just humiliating because defeat is humiliating   i decided not to include the mane 6 or cmc because that would be just opening up a can of worms of complications exceptions being where they were not in their right mind  transformed  possessed  etc   i also did nt include the comics continuity  as that would really complicate things  also i have nt read all of them    sp     twiponder  diamond tiara was especially tricky  not only because she s so often an antagonist but because a lot of the time she does nt even really have any goals besides being a jerk to the cmc there were times she was humiliated where karma sought to make her fall her face or something  but not really defeated because she did nt have any plans or goals to defeat oddly enough  the number of defeats and humiliations came out the same    sp     twisecret  keep in mind that the way i m using  antagonist  here does nt necessarily mean  villain   for example  i included tree hugger because discord is the protagonist of  make friends but keep discord   and she  mostly without even knowing it  is his rival and standing in the way of his goals

6536,mylittlepony,a few thoughts  silver spoon was nt redeemed  she just went solo  iron will is nt an antagonist fluttershy s challenge was with herself  flutterbat was nt an antagonist either she was a plot device 
6537,mylittlepony,when was trixie redeemed  and when did she fall  also  should nt the fruit bats be considered redeemed  since they ended up serving a useful purpose  rather than a destructive one 
6538,mylittlepony,should nt sunset have a fallen sticker  she went straight demon mode after all  edit  when did spitfire  fall

6540,mylittlepony,i ca nt read it too small even downloading it did nt help

6542,mylittlepony,holy mother of extensive charts

6548,mylittlepony,why is the cockatrice marked as defeated but not humiliated and the dragon humiliated but not defeated  when both suffered pretty much identical fates 
6549,mylittlepony,it d be interesting to see how this chart changes if you include the comics 
6550,mylittlepony,i object to angel being considered an antagonist 
6551,mylittlepony,she s taken everything from her channel down except this   <URL>  v  v7kpdatfxjc who would do such a thing to her 
6552,mylittlepony,i do nt even know who this is and i feel sad    i hate to imagine what upset her so much  any idea what happened 
6553,mylittlepony,i m guessing someone said something that hurt her i know how that feels if i was in her situation  i probably would nt come back to youtube  either i ve never really heard of pinkie rose before  but she sounds like a talented person i hope she makes the right decision with all of this  edit  i now realize this is a bigger situation than mean comments i apologize for making the situation seem less important than it is i hope she s alright 
6554,mylittlepony,i do nt know who this is and what kind of content they created  besides voice acting as she said   but what happened  god damn 
6555,mylittlepony,   fluttershh  i love pinkie rose  she made a lot of great videos and while i am sad that she quit the fandom why did she delete the videos  so many people liked them 
6556,mylittlepony,i have links to some of her videos saved luckily  she did nt delete everything everything s just been set to private still  i hope everything turns out ok 
6557,mylittlepony,ms pinkie rose  i dunno if you ll ever read this  and i do nt know if you come to this sub at all  but in the off chance you do  just know that we re all there for you if you need to chat do nt do anything irrational  and we here will always love you for who you are 
6558,mylittlepony,i hope that there s a way to turn this around i ca nt bear to see people in trouble 
6559,mylittlepony,who is pinkie rose  and what exactly did she do  and why did she leave 
6560,mylittlepony, i should probrably not get sucked into this but i ll just go for it anyway and see what happens no regrets yet  it s really a shame when people throw out all of there work  and leave no evidence or context of what happened  i know she is hurt  but i know idea why we can sit hear and get all emotional about it  or move on because she s cut down her lines of communication down to one last video and what is now possibly a dead channel  all in all there is nothing to see here or do  for all who think i m being a jerk ok sure  i d say she is already long gone and will never come back  she already cause this much selfdestruction  her best option is really not to come back and just have fun doing something else  she sounds young and not mature enough to handle the demands of her audience 13ksubs like that can be alot of pressure the demands she could have made for herself and the regular online nasty that comes with ever increasing exposure  what she really needs is a good talking to which does nt seem possible anymore unless she steps forward  begging her to come back wo nt make things better it makes things complicated and it s not good for what seems to me a formative experience  and op ugreninjasheik1 gt  who would do such a thing to her  really  tier 1 shit concerns  it actually does nt matter anymore  nor should we care who or what kind of person did whatever they did  what matter is how to help  secondly it sounds like from what she said  i ve done some things i ve said some things  that she is taking some fault and responsiblity of something or anything and with  they ve been circling around  it also seems like her trust has been betrayed  chances are she connected her youtube channel and twitter account too close to her personal life and has reaped the consequences of having such a set up for convenience  something that kids would do without thinking too much into it  actually with all this said i realize that i m wasting my time  gg game over she is nt coming back  why should we care like really   nobody can help other than spam her with consolation to her now dead channel     discordgrump     walkingabout  i m out

6563,mylittlepony, life as we know it plays in the backgroud     c11 
6564,mylittlepony,   twismile  i actually think it s really interesting when someone creates a story in which twilight and spike s relationship evolves into something romantic     sp     twicrazy  as long as it s after a timeskip from the show so spike is a celestiadamned adult for crying out loud     sp     rarityreally  besides  twilight will probably need a similar amount of time to reach the same level of emotional maturity i mean  in show time she s barely cared about friends for  2 years     sp     twisquint     sp     raritypaper  what  it s true

6607,mylittlepony,   twismile  this project ended up being a lot more subjective than i originally thought when i started it there were a bunch of times i was on the fence about a certain character or situation  does that constitute a defeat     was that a humiliation  or is it just humiliating because defeat is humiliating   i decided not to include the mane 6 or cmc because that would be just opening up a can of worms of complications exceptions being where they were not in their right mind  transformed  possessed  etc   i also did nt include the comics continuity  as that would really complicate things  also i have nt read all of them    sp     twiponder  diamond tiara was especially tricky  not only because she s so often an antagonist but because a lot of the time she does nt even really have any goals besides being a jerk to the cmc there were times she was humiliated where karma sought to make her fall her face or something  but not really defeated because she did nt have any plans or goals to defeat oddly enough  the number of defeats and humiliations came out the same    sp     twisecret  keep in mind that the way i m using  antagonist  here does nt necessarily mean  villain   for example  i included tree hugger because discord is the protagonist of  make friends but keep discord   and she  mostly without even knowing it  is his rival and standing in the way of his goals

6610,mylittlepony,a few thoughts  silver spoon was nt redeemed  she just went solo  iron will is nt an antagonist fluttershy s challenge was with herself  flutterbat was nt an antagonist either she was a plot device 
6611,mylittlepony,when was trixie redeemed  and when did she fall  also  should nt the fruit bats be considered redeemed  since they ended up serving a useful purpose  rather than a destructive one 
6612,mylittlepony,should nt sunset have a fallen sticker  she went straight demon mode after all  edit  when did spitfire  fall  
6613,mylittlepony,does the f stand for friendshipfatality 
6614,mylittlepony,i ca nt read it too small even downloading it did nt help  
6615,mylittlepony,i did nt really see sea breeze as an antagonist he was just frustrated and wanted to get home to his family 
6616,mylittlepony,holy mother of extensive charts  
6617,mylittlepony,   cocosad  what has coco done to deserve being called an antagonist 
6618,mylittlepony,awesome 
6619,mylittlepony,wait  why is nt sombra included 
6620,mylittlepony,sombra and iron will are redemed in the comics the comics also include the only sentient villain in the show that they straight up kill 
6621,mylittlepony,   flutterwhoa  pinkie clones  killed  skull icon  that s rough 
6622,mylittlepony,why is the cockatrice marked as defeated but not humiliated and the dragon humiliated but not defeated  when both suffered pretty much identical fates 
6623,mylittlepony,it d be interesting to see how this chart changes if you include the comics 
6624,mylittlepony,i object to angel being considered an antagonist 
6625,mylittlepony,   trixiechaos  was trixie really redeemed  i know she said she was redeemed but can you trust somepony called trixie

6736,mylittlepony,   scootaeww  i wanted to be in the front lines like dash  and her i am in communications with derpy 
6737,mylittlepony,she s taken everything from her channel down except this   <URL>  v  v7kpdatfxjc who would do such a thing to her 
6738,mylittlepony,i do nt even know who this is and i feel sad    i hate to imagine what upset her so much  any idea what happened 
6739,mylittlepony,i m guessing someone said something that hurt her i know how that feels if i was in her situation  i probably would nt come back to youtube  either i ve never really heard of pinkie rose before  but she sounds like a talented person i hope she makes the right decision with all of this  edit  i now realize this is a bigger situation than mean comments i apologize for making the situation seem less important than it is i hope she s alright 
6740,mylittlepony,i do nt know who this is and what kind of content they created  besides voice acting as she said   but what happened  god damn 
6741,mylittlepony,   fluttershh  i love pinkie rose  she made a lot of great videos and while i am sad that she quit the fandom why did she delete the videos  so many people liked them 
6742,mylittlepony,never heard of her and do nt really know the circumstances  sucks when one person drives someone else out of a fandom they loved  but it s not that <URL> anymore 
6743,mylittlepony,i have links to some of her videos saved luckily  she did nt delete everything everything s just been set to private still  i hope everything turns out ok 
6744,mylittlepony,ms pinkie rose  i dunno if you ll ever read this  and i do nt know if you come to this sub at all  but in the off chance you do  just know that we re all there for you if you need to chat do nt do anything irrational  and we here will always love you for who you are 
6745,mylittlepony,i sent her an encouraging message on youtube i hope she reads it 
6746,mylittlepony,i hope that there s a way to turn this around i ca nt bear to see people in trouble 
6747,mylittlepony,who is pinkie rose  and what exactly did she do  and why did she leave 
6748,mylittlepony, i should probrably not get sucked into this but i ll just go for it anyway and see what happens no regrets yet  it s really a shame when people throw out all of there work  and leave no evidence or context of what happened  i know she is hurt  but i know idea why we can sit hear and get all emotional about it  or move on because she s cut down her lines of communication down to one last video and what is now possibly a dead channel  all in all there is nothing to see here or do  for all who think i m being a jerk ok sure  i d say she is already long gone and will never come back  she already cause this much selfdestruction  her best option is really not to come back and just have fun doing something else  she sounds young and not mature enough to handle the demands of her audience 13ksubs like that can be alot of pressure the demands she could have made for herself and the regular online nasty that comes with ever increasing exposure  what she really needs is a good talking to which does nt seem possible anymore unless she steps forward  begging her to come back wo nt make things better it makes things complicated and it s not good for what seems to me a formative experience  and op ugreninjasheik1 gt  who would do such a thing to her  really  tier 1 shit concerns  it actually does nt matter anymore  nor should we care who or what kind of person did whatever they did  what matter is how to help  secondly it sounds like from what she said  i ve done some things i ve said some things  that she is taking some fault and responsiblity of something or anything and with  they ve been circling around  it also seems like her trust has been betrayed  chances are she connected her youtube channel and twitter account too close to her personal life and has reaped the consequences of having such a set up for convenience  something that kids would do without thinking too much into it  actually with all this said i realize that i m wasting my time  gg game over she is nt coming back  why should we care like really   nobody can help other than spam her with consolation to her now dead channel     discordgrump     walkingabout  i m out

6775,mylittlepony,i ve heard a lot of folks talking about the various aus from the season 5 finale  but most seem to focus on the crystal war i think we re overlooking a  huge  one  though the nightmare moon timeline  so  here s the aus we see in the episode   crystal war timelineponies locked in an endless civil war  changeling timelineponies driven to the brink of extinction    by changelings  nightmare timelinewe ll get to this in a minute  tirek timelineget rekt  equestria  discord timelinediscord ruins everything  flim and flam timelineget rekt  again   equestria  apocalypse timelineequestria done got rekt in contrast to all of the above  the nightmare timeline seems rather stable rarity tells twilight that the castle is closed to toursimplying that ponies have both the leisure time and disposable <URL> to go travelling further  nightmare moon says that celestia has been trapped for  years  thus  whatever changes she s had to make to the status quo  equestria has apparently been pretty stable  both rarity and rainbow dash are mean to twilight  but this could be due to the circumstancessomeone claiming to be a princess has charged into the literal royal palace  after visiting hours are over  their brusqueness is  at least  understandable  same goes for nightmare moon s obsessive desire to hoard magic  in addition to her inborn jealousy  she was banished for 1000 years using powerful magic  it s would be natural for her to want to keep  powerful  magic out of the hooves of the common people  so  friendship is replaced by fascism  but otherwise  not much has apparently changed personally  i find this au the most interesting of the seven presented  and i would love to see a little more of it  in fanfic  etc 
6776,mylittlepony,i ll agree with that most people seem to have gone with the idea that everypony would be dead  but i ve not agreed with that given the world involved  maybe now someone ll pick up on the idea  i might  but i ve got something else going on at the moment later perhaps

7002,startrek,would nt spock have found it a bit  insulting  to have been referred to as the  most human soul  kirk had encountered  i love the scene  but that quote always seemed slightly off to me  thoughts 
7003,startrek,also  what is a soul
7004,startrek,spock was half human and had worked for some time on understanding  feeling and showing his human emotions it was a heartfelt compliment and would have been taken so i m sure 
7005,startrek,i got a notice from audible this afternoon that the new book from uwilliamshatner about leonard has been released i know what i will be listening to in the car this week    <URL>   <URL>
7006,startrek,i kinda hope parts of the proceeds go to a charity  or else  in my unimportant opinion  its a kind of morally questionable thing to make money from 
7007,startrek,star trek the next generation final episode 7937 days ago star trek the original series final episode 1<SMILE>056 days ago i thought putting in in days offers a new perspective 
7008,startrek,so  i m in my first viewing of voyager  and i have to say that this is probably one of the funniest episodes i have seen so far  there are other pure comedy episodes but this one takes the cake the doctor is such a lovable character  looking for parmac  spelling   in all the wrong places  our man bashir  little green men  that episode with barclay in tng when he goes  james bondish   bride of chaotica  mmm those come to mind right now  i m certain there are others  but this one is just 45 minutes of grinning and laughing with a few  serious  moments to catch your breath  and i like it when star trek goes out of its way to make something lighthearted and fun amidst all the starfleet protocol  so anyway  season 6  and i have to say that voyager is way better than people make it out to be  it does have its problems  but if you are watching a series about a starship that can travel faster than the speed of light  a few extra shuttlecrafts or writers with hangover once in a while should not be your main focus  he caracters are great  just like every other series  even when they start very lame and unlikable  they grow on you a lot  even neelix  for example  piccard s1e1 was a dick  tucker s1e1 was generic texas boy  bashir uggghhh  even the sisko  you get the idea  anyway  i m getting close to complete the whole voyage  but looking forward to july and even more to 2017  llap 
7009,startrek,it took me quite i while to get into but i ended up enjoying enterprise  not quite as much as the others but still some good memories that is  when i wasnt getting angry at the forced love plot  with trip and tpol or the blatent and obscene sexing up of her character unlike many i enjoyed the long arch of the expanse  anyhow enough on that for now what else can scratch the trek itch  i havent gotten through all of ds9 yet mainly because i found the religious stuff hard to palate but if i got through all of enterprise s trangressions i imagine ds9 will be tame in comparison  what else is there non trek  since ive watched them all now apart from the remainder of ds9  i am trying babylon 5 again since it has alot of rave reviews and high sci fi cred from all ive read i dont expect super special effects but the show is so low budget i find it jarring and hard to get into i saw an episode with some ant creature and it was star trek original series bad and the sets seem so cramped it gives the impression of being filmed in someones backyard garage i will keep trying with it though maybe things smooth out  i mean tng was filmed before that by quite a few years and nearly always looked classy  i have been trying battlestar galactica but after a few episodes that seems like quite a mockery of the genre and grotesquely overrated i feel everything in life has continued to go downhill after the millenium everything was gold in the <SMILE>0s and 90s  andromeda looks to be a sleeper hit i have on my rader  so what say ye all you star trek stalwarts  what will satisfy my yearning heart 
7010,startrek,it s been said twice already  but deserves reinforcing   stick with b5   the first season is a little rough  but the second season picks up a lot londo and gkar <URL> so much better characters  and garibaldi and ivanova are pretty great too and there s a new station commander plus there s a good bit of crossover with trek actors  walter koenig plays a phenomenal villainous psicorps villain  majel barrett roddenberry plays the centauri emperor s wife  and andreas katsulas  who plays gkar  was the romulan commander tomalak in several tng episodes 
7011,startrek,just thought i d share this with the community it gives you a good idea of how big  or small   the 1701 is compared to the supercarrier some more images here    <URL>
7012,startrek,i get 17060 days from final episode     turnabout intruder        enwikipediaorgwikiturnabout_intruder  on june 3  1969 to february 14  2016 this includes all leap days between 1969 until now i think you re calculating from the date of the  first  aired episode   the man trap  
7013,startrek,that s pretty cool have any companies made a 1350 scale enterprise d yet  i know the thing would be 6 ft long  but it would be one hell of a model if you had the space for it 
7014,startrek,glad you re enjoying it  voyager did humour really well  in addition to the two you mentioned  there s also message in a bottle  life line  life fast and prosper  living witness  body and soul  someone to watch over me  author  author 
7015,startrek,i actually just watched the last episode a few days ago it broke my heart  and that damn theme song its so happy and coy and bubbly and the worst part is  if you listen to it enough times  you actually begin to like it 
7016,startrek,can i see the following films after watching tng tv series without watching other spinoffs  ds9  voy  ent  1 star trek generations  1994  2 star trek  first contact  1996  3 star trek  insurrection  199<SMILE>  4 star trek  nemesis  2002 
7017,startrek,i was wondering about this how much voyager and ds9 are presented in the show  these type of events usually end being a tostng lovefest 
7018,startrek,i just came back and it was really great even if someone is unfamiliar with st  it s worth going just for the live orchestra alone the show is 2 hours long with intermission in between on a big screen they are showing clips from tv shows and movies that are cut to go with each specific peace of music the show is also notated by michael dorn  here are your dates in case your interested    <URL>
7019,startrek,i wonder where the original 35mm footage of that tour ended up  would ve been cool to get that in hd on the blurays

7022,startrek,there s  the expanse  on sci fi i m watching it now and enjoying it 
7023,startrek,getting from there to here
7024,startrek,this is why the other theme songs do nt have lyrics 
7025,startrek,i hate the song so much that i set it as my alarm tune  nothing gets me bed out faster than  make that damn song stop 
7026,startrek,totally karaoked this one at the las vegas convention a few years back  i sort of like the song but i ca nt get over the fact that it s a rod stewart tune seems like they could have done something original 
7027,startrek,  <URL>  v  2y7egqzqkzw
7028,startrek,getting from there ta heeeyah 
7029,startrek,get out 
7030,startrek,i do nt care what anyone says  i enjoy that song for a show about humans finally getting serious about space travel  i think it fits perfectly 
7031,startrek, cringe 
7032,startrek,i m looking down a long road  doctor this man did nt die for nothing the data that i gathered is invaluable it will eventually help save thousands of lives 
7033,startrek,i d say trek stargate is definitely nerdy  but it s also more militaristic and in some cases funny than trek ever was 
7034,startrek,why is this an argument both are pretty nerdy for own separate reasons  they are both awesome  i do nt think it matters 
7035,startrek,what is your definition of nerdy  also do you mean the content is more nerdy or you mean it attracts more nerds 
7036,startrek,stargate  simply for the bit where oneil wants to call the ship they build the enterprise 
7037,startrek,from what i can remember of stargate  trek had more techno babble in it stargate just had a big dude with a belt buckle on his forehead 
7038,startrek,the disputed planet in the enterprise episode  cease fire  is the only example i can think of  it s called weytahn by the andorians and paan mokar by the vulcans 
7039,startrek,i was rewatching bobw 1 and 2 and noticed when the  enterprise  reached sol  riker ordered  slow to impulse  should nt they stay in warp  otherwise they re going to spend a  long  time trying to intercept the borg cube or does impulse also allow ftl travel in a slower manner  i m reminded of the beginning to tuc when sulu says the  excelsior  is  heading home on impulse power  i play elite  dangerous a lot and there are two ways to travel ftl one is for in system travel  then the huge jump between systems  essentially  i m clueless and would like your thoughts and opinions 
7040,startrek,to use elite terminology  supercruise is impulse except that impulse ca nt deliver ftl speed when supercruise at its top speed can warp speed is your pure ftl speed similar to what jumping to another star system in elite 
7041,startrek,arguing over which is nerdiest is the nerdiest thing of all 
7042,startrek,the plots to ds9 and voyager do nt cross at all they take place in entirely different parts of the galaxy  personally  i would nt <URL> watching them simultaneously ds9 was one of the shows that would set the template for the golden age of television the character development and serialization are fantastic i prefer to get immersed in series like that voyager would only suck you out of it  so  i d vote for separately but that s just how i like to watch shows 
7043,startrek,as i ve said here and elsewhere  all that panic at the disco was unnecessary it was simply amazon s license was up for renewal but everyone went off halfcocked  speculating that cbs was pulling everything from streaming and moving it to all access  relax  folks  everyone grab a green drink and chill 
7044,startrek,i m almost done with ds9 i hope i can get through voy and ent before it goes away for good 
7045,startrek,it always seems to be a rule to slow to impulse when you re in a system my guess is in crowded areas with many other ships or gravitational sources  the risk of getting your warp field disrupted is higher it could also be a precision thing stopping on a dime at warp 9 and then being in orbit can be problematic  making sure you do nt run into a planet or a achieve a stable orbit  if we believe the new movies  a warp field can be sustained under the gravitational force of a black hole  and without warp cores   but coming out of warp is coming out blind which could result in you coming out into a debris field 
7046,startrek,in a nutshell  impulse power is used for sublight travel and warp is used for ftl speeds as far as i know  impulse power is not capable of achieving any ftl travel the quote from  star trek vi  the undiscovered country  is most likely a writing error  but i m sure explanations have been conceived of  in regards to  best of both worlds    star trek  has always been wildly inconsistent about its use of impulse versus warp power when in a star system dialogue has established multiple times that ships should travel at impulse power when in a star system for safety concerns however  visually  we see ships going to warp all the time when in a star system even worse  kirk and crew jump to warp in the   atmosphere   of earth in  star trek iv  the voyage home  
7047,startrek,there is no downside beside the shift in quality and style  but i did nt find that to be a problem either when it was initially broadcast or on a recent chronological rewatch there is a small amount of overlap  and voyager s pilot episode involves it being at ds9   but it s fairly minor background elements that wo nt make much of a difference  i prefer the broadcast order because i like those extra bits and you get the same context the production team expected  though you ca nt  really  go wrong with either approach 
7048,startrek,impulse power is highly inconsistent with measurements like  14 impulse  apparently measuring 14 the maximum output of a given vessel s impulse engines rather than a measurement of speed  14 impulse from a shuttle is very different from 14 impulse from a starship  the star trek voyager technical manual lists full impulse as 14th the speed of light if we assume that the enterprised engines have the same capability  although theirs may be slower or faster   then dropping out of warp around the orbit of neptune would put the ship  45 billion kms from earth  at full impulse  14 the speed of light   wolfram alpha says it d take 60042 seconds  or 1001 minutes  or 166<SMILE> hours which is nt too bad dropping out of warp closer to saturn  4725 hours  or jupiter  233 hours  would shave a considerable amount of time off that estimate  of course  tos has scotty saying that the romulan ships use  simple impulse  but still have interstellar capabilities  tl  dr  it s not clear
7049,startrek,thanks  i played this as a kid one of the first games we got for our windows 31 pc  the first alien i encounter playing it right now destroyed my phaser banks in the first volley _
7050,startrek,let s just say  it s up to the screenwriter and plot   generally speaking  warp is between stars and impulse is between planets  however  we ve seen way too many instances of ships dropping out of warp conveniently right next to the planet they re going  and so on like in st  id  enterprise conveniently dropped out of warp right next to earth  if i remember elite  there are actually four drive systems the regular engines you fly around in  and combat with   the microjump that lets you travel forward a bit until you get too close to someone  jump drive to take you to another star system  depending on your fuel range   and galactic jump drive  take you to another galaxy    
7051,startrek,phew  watching tng for the first time  it s awesome  and was afraid i was going to get cut off 
7052,startrek,someone did a great list of how the episodes in each series ends up in the time line    <URL>
7053,startrek,its still not available in the uk tho  
7054,startrek,i got excited for a moment then realized it was ega trek that i played as a kid
7055,startrek,wow  i played that at school  wonder who put it on there i hated this came yet always came back for more  is that tobias richter game on archiveorg as well  i remember it being rather pointless but really pretty 
7056,startrek,well that s a good sign so far maybe it wo nt be doomed to cbs all access 
7057,startrek,my uncle had this game and was the one that got me into computing i remember playing it all the time  thanks for this it reminds me of him 
7058,startrek,this is going to be interesting to watch it may be more of a stay of execution  one that just kicks the can down the road i personally think cbs making all access  the  place for trek is still a very real possibility  if not an eventuality  to be sure  fans clamoring for a  free lunch   or simply the network model in streaming form  for pennies on the dollar   are going to be quite upset when content creators wo nt stand for that that day is likely coming and this goes way beyond the 2017 trek series  just wait until disney does something crazy  like buying netflix for their own personal streaming platform then watch the chaos unfold 
7059,startrek,i tried it and i am too young to understand
7060,startrek,like every other comment  played this as a kid on the family s first computer with w31 i remember talking way to much time trying to get just the right angle to fire torpedoes at 
7061,startrek,i kinda want cbs to offer all access through amazon it would certainly cut down on how many subscriptions i would need the problem would be streaming some of their live stuff  like big brother 
7062,startrek,hmm  seems like a primitive ftl
7063,startrek,too young to have played this game  but as a software engineer i am amazed how do i use the phasers though 
7064,startrek,where to start with this  based on no information about the show  before any casting has occurred you are worried about a highly specific storyline that exists nowhere 
7065,startrek,gay characters are fine i just do nt want their sexuality to be constantly spotlighted it should be as subtle as anyone else s sexuality they should just be a regular freaking person if they have a relationship with someone of the same gender  it should just be a regular thing it should nt be a big deal the whole thing should just be completely normal and not given any special attention in this way  we can see these characters the same way we see anyone else it was a big deal to have a gay character on tv in the 90s or the 00s it s time to make it as transparent and ordinary as it was to have a black captain or a female captain do nt focus on it or highlight it just have it be a normal thing i  definitely  do nt to watch a show with an antigay crew member so we can continue this ridiculous debate of whether or not we should treat gay people like normal people just make it obvious that by the 24th century  nobody will give a single shit about which gender you re making out with 
7066,startrek,i ve never understood why people have trouble with the idea that  how  you travel in time affects how time travel works  the same way that a pillowfight and a swordfight are both examples of hitting things with an object  but only one of them tends to result in somebody bleeding to death  unless your pillowfights are  hardcore   
7067,startrek,this was a very interesting read thank you 
7068,startrek,if they do get captain angela bassett and first officer rosario dawson to be captain and first officer you think they will make them have some sort of lesbian thing going on  i know when they first announced the new show a lot of people were hoping for a gay captain were super pumped for the new show  just hoping the focus of the new series is nt the captains love life with their first officer i dont really care if they make the captain a lesbian just worried in the world of modern tv that it will be the focus of the entire show also does anyone else prefer they continue after the return of voyager and not just make a reboot 
7069,startrek,if they do get captain patrick stewart and first officer jonathan frakes to be captain and first officer you think they will make them have some sort of gay thing going on  i know when they first announced the new show a lot of people were hoping for a gay captain were super pumped for the new show  just hoping the focus of the new series is nt the captains love life with their first officer i dont really care if they make the captain a gay just worried in the world of modern tv that it will be the focus of the entire show also does anyone else prefer they continue after the five year mission and not just make a reboot 
7070,startrek,she says ds9 is good  but you ca nt beat tng  she did enjoy voyager  got her to watch the rest  but it does come last  1 tng 2 ds9 3 voyager i said  good girl     i will update if i manage to get her to watch ent  all agreed on that ranking   edit  clarity 
7071,startrek,would nt agree with that ranking  but good on you for getting her to watch them  i ve done the same with my partner  she d only seen tng  but she has now watched the others  halfway through enterprise  and ranks ds9 as the best 
7072,startrek,tng ds9 ent tos tas voy
7073,startrek,all agreed on that ranking 
7074,startrek,ds9 tng voy tos ent just my opinion tho picard kirk sisko janeway archer
7075,startrek,oh yeah  and her favourite episode of ds9  the magnificent ferengi   she finds the ferengi funny 
7076,startrek,i m still reeling form the enterprise cancellation i really liked the idea of going back to when they first started out in space  i have nt read too much about the new series i know everyone is clamoring for info i agree with you though  do nt make it a lesbian love story let that aspect be a substory line that is nt heavily followed make it more about space exploration and growth as a civilization  with story lines like that peppered in  i kind of want to see a story set at the same time as tng but with a different ship  this time i hope they stay away from a crappy theme song with lyrics though 
7077,startrek,the timelines are always affected in the same way  whether there is a loop or an alternate universe what is shown to the audience is simply a matter of perspective so yes  in the  prime  universe the enterprisec goes back to their own timeline and creates the loop that we accept in the canon  prime  timeline  but there is also an alternate universe where they do not return to their time it simply is nt shown to the audience because the loop is what defines the  prime  timeline  as uhmsbountya said  it s up to the writers  but i think that the distinction between different forms of time travel is moot when you look at the big picture that does nt mean this is nt an interesting  wellresearched article  just that there are a lot of semantics involved when the reality is that every possible timeline is occurring and not occurring simultaneously and the only people who define what is and is not part of the  prime  timeline are the writers  which is a disappointing conclusion to an otherwise interesting thought experiment 
7078,startrek,gt  all agreed on that ranking  no 
7079,startrek,i agree tng gt  ds9 gt  voy  but there are a lot of niners on this subreddit 
7080,startrek,nope   ds9 is first by a very long margin on my book 
7081,startrek,it s got ta be tng voyager ds9 for me i love all of then for so many different reasons  and it s actually neck and neck with tng and voyager
7082,startrek,i understand it d be hard to sell a show in 2001 with tech that looks pretos  but is there ever explanation for all the lovely lcd screens and nicely designed weapons in this show that go away in the future 
7083,startrek,the tech is pretty fluid i actually like the look of the enterprise much more militaristic than tos or anything next gen and above  the creators of enterprise had a difficult job tos was pretty mind blowing in the 60 s  but looks pretty dated in 2001 inuniverse this enterprise would have been even less technical than tos enterprise  but audiences watching it would not buy it just imagine trying to design tech that would look 100 years old to characters in tos  the new movies just completely destroyed any continuity and put tech into tos era star ships that did not even exist in the 24th century  it gets a little crazy trying to figure this stuff out   
7084,startrek,there was an idea i read that they went to an older style of tech as a counter to information warfare during the earthromulan war  but i m not sure that s actually supported by anything 
7085,startrek,generally this sub heavily favors ds9 for the top spot really there s no bad ranking it s a lot of really great television 
7086,startrek,no  1 tos 2 tng 3 ds9 4 tas 5 voy 6 ent
7087,startrek,gt  correction feb 16  2016 <URL> is a parody website    which was nt immediately clear to us    really 
7088,startrek,the  actual source   satirical       <URL> 
7089,startrek,holy shit the irrational hate of simon pegg here is astounding the pr people for into darkness told the actors not to confirm kahn so simon pegg ruined star trek  the trailer  that he hated and said did nt reflect the movie  did nt seem like star trek so the movie is terrible  you people need yo calm the fuck down 
7090,startrek,the writing in that article was odd  like it had been written in italian and run through google translates 
7091,startrek,i keep on saying this but this show is really good so far i really love how this show takes an idea and just takes it everywhere it can go it really appeals to me and i am really enjoying watching the next thing that they explore i feel like i have a lot to say this time around so let s get to it   redemption  part ii not really as good as part 1 but some solid battles and data got time to shine pretty cool   darmok very good it finally helped me understand the universal translator and it was a really solid view at language and culture exchange that kept an interesting core to avoid being dull   ensign ro i know the bajorans <URL> important later and this was quite a good intro i had a hard time following the actual plot but ro was nice and it was saved by her character   silicon avatar the plot took a long journey before discovering what it was but what it was  was pretty damn good the story of revenge and the federation neglecting someone like that was very interesting and the ending was bold   disaster great character episode some cool and unusual pairings and great dialogue plot was ok too  i guess   the game while i did nt particularly desire to see wesley again this episode was nice and creepy but i ca nt say it s a new favourite of mine  either   unification very nice i liked seeing spock and the plot kept itself engaging throughout got slightly weaker when sela showed up but overall it was very well done and picard had a lot of great moments   a matter of honor i mean perspective i mean time certainly watchable but him being a conman was a bit obvious i liked some interactions between rasmussen and the crew but overall it was rather dull the actual problemsolving and picard s dilemma was really solid though   new ground not being a member of the fandom i do nt know what people think of alexander i think i quite like him the actor is really bad  but i like the way he acts as a foil for worf and he certainly brings something new to the show now the episode itself was pretty standard and only really got good during the ending   hero worship this was a fun episode  if a bit low on substance the child actor was  again  not that great but the episode was just a nice bit of fluff and there was some nice data scenes in there   violations well this episode was weird little actual plot and it was about rape overall i was nt that engaged but i did nt hate it either   the masterpiece society terribly dull it was way too much like a tos episode and troi romances seem to be doomed to be boring and unbelievably dumb but i did like the morality discussions quite a bit and that part was quite nice   conundrum really solid i liked the concept and the characters are explored from a whole new angle ro and riker have surprisingly good chemistry and the mystery aspect was well executed   power play the actors probably had a field day with this one and the possesed people did a bangup job of playing hose roles as for the actual plot i found the enterprise caper a lot more engaging than the old ship stuff and the ending did nt give me much but i ca nt say i dislike it   ethics great drama  if a bit soapy worf was very much in character but the real interesting stuff was between crusher and ellen degeneres  android clone ellenbot 3000 really did show the varied nature of people within the federation and she provided a different viewpoint in a believable way i mean you know they wo nt kill off worf but it was pretty nice to see him walking at the end   the outcast really good even if it does play it pretty safe in some areas the concept is interesting and wellexplored and the ending is wonderfully horrible  reminiscent of the city on the edge of forever i really liked soren s character and her and riker had a very genuine chemistry  maybe jonathan frakes just has chemistry with everyone   cause and effect loved it the looping was really well directed and executed and the plot got the concept across  while still moving forward and the characters got a chance to figure out a mystery   the first duty we are not allowed to forget wesley apparently but again  solid episode and putting a former main character in this morally wrong position and having picard absolutely fuming was a very bold choice and it gives some interesting insight into starfleet everyday   cost of living uhhhhhhh i did not need an alexandermama troi episode in my life i did nt get the holodeck scenes  alexander is kind of a twat and i was just not engaged surprisingly my favourite thing about it was lwaxana s relationship with her husbandtobe and the stuff around that   the perfect mate i feel really bad the episode is almost too good at presenting the metamorph character and the ending made me feel like shit the scenes with kamala and picard were fantastic  but i ca nt say i cared much for her scenes of seducing various men but as a concept episode it was pretty great what  there were ferengi in this episode  huh   imaginary friend more fucking children please stop doing this forever tng i was constantly groaning during this episode it mixes horrible child acting  the cassandra truth clich   a particular pet peeve of mine   and a moral issue that really did not need to be explored why did they make this   i borg absolutely fantastic it develops the borg in a great way and the various characters  response to everything was great prejudice  individuality and lot of interesting points are explored and hugh was great to see develop geordi got a chance to shine and the ending was kind of sad  but still ambiguous enough to be slightly hopeful   the next phase really liked it  the mystery was cool and the concept was well explored and the funeral planning and data stuff was just sweet as hell and i m really starting to love ro   the inner light  aka the one were picard <URL> jorel  well that out of the way this one is popular and i mean i liked it it was great as an exploration of life and picard got some really good stuff i wanted to see the episode develop and the ending was absolutely great i can see why people have a fondness for it   time s arrow  part i love it data is wonderful as a french inventor and i am really excited to see where it goes i did nt care much for the alien stuff but people s reaction to the data death stuff was very nice looking forward to part 2   now keep in mind this is a long list and i might misremember some episodes  or give them a weird rating it s also like 330 am as i write this i also might have been a bit to favourable this time aorund but what the hell until next time 
7092,startrek,before this turns into the circle jerk everyone take a breath and relax yes he lied earlier  but he might also be giving us a legit trek movie now that he s the one writing it the  admittedly rough  trailer shows that it s probably going to play out like one of the more action heavy tos episodes 
7093,startrek,i m watching  the empath  now and i m wondering if the vians are related to the talosians they both have large cerebrums  keep aliens as experiments  and can create illusions 
7094,startrek,i always figured that s just what happens to advanced aliens in the trek universe you go underground  your head gets really big and veiny  and you get psychic powers and use them to mess with people either that or you turn into a glowing ball of energy 
7095,startrek,i have faith in simon pegg i hope the movie delivers 
7096,startrek,simon pegg can go fuck himself and never touch anything trek again 
7097,startrek, spock lived up to the ideals of humanity better than any human i have met  it s a pretty deep compliment 
7098,startrek,there s no canon relationship 
7099,startrek,no uk dates   
7100,startrek,so in this video i explore 7 worlds that spock may wish to visit in the new timeline  1 talos iv from  the cage  2 paradise planet  shore leave  3 the unknown planet from  the city on the edge of forever  4 asteroid in gamma canaris region  metamorphosis  5 kelvin planet by any other name  6 sargon s world  return to tomorrow  7 holberg 917g  requiem for methuselah 
7101,startrek,  <URL>
7102,startrek,i really want to see adam west as spock 
7103,startrek,without seeing worf s face on your body  this is nt so much a faceswap as it is  i photoshopped my face onto worf s head 
7104,startrek,okay  as we know from tng  troi had to take a command test to gain the ability to <URL> an official bridge commander  raising her from lt commander to full commander  why did nt data have to do that before tng as a series started in order to <URL> second officer  he was directly in the chain of command  3rd    and is seen holding official command watches on the bridge during the whole show yet  at no point during or before the show did he have to take a test and <URL> a full commander i do nt get it 
7105,startrek,you have to take the test at some point in order to <URL> a full commander  but that does nt mean you ca nt take it earlier as the second officer on the ship he would have been required to take it before assuming that role you ll notice how troi is outside of that chain of command  which i believe goes picardrikerdataworf   worf probably had also already taken that test as a bridge officer my assumption is  and i do nt know if this is ever directly talked about  that troi is nt officially a bridge officer she is officially a counselor  picard just has her work on the bridge so that she can sense feelings about people over the viewscreen 
7106,startrek,you have to take a test to stand bridge watches in the position to command the ship  there are nt tests to advance in rank as an officer one would assume that any person in a command position like data would have completed it years ago troi was more of an advisor on the bridge as her official position was ships counsellor the the direct chain of command did nt include her  on a ship you would stand watches in your division  with troi being in the medical field her watch duties would probably have been in medical and not on the bridge she decided that she wanted to also take watches on the bridge that is why she took the test  here is some information on it the bridge officers test is only for those that want to stand bridge watches and are not a command officer   <URL>  27s_test data would not have had to take it as he was a command officer i do nt think trois promotion had anything to do with the test other than it gave her an edge in a ranking board 
7107,startrek,i think you re confusing the bridge officer test with the promotion and assume they are the same  they are separate events promotions have to go through a review board at starfleet hq  assuming starfleet works similar to the us navy  and get approved or denied  bridge officer  conn holder  is an elective course that can be taken by staff  nonline  officers not in the chain of command to make them eligible for bridge duty and chain of command 
7108,startrek,bit off topic  but reading some of the comments  it makes me wonder how on voyager  from the start in the alpha quadrant  their head of operations was an ensign  surely there were more qualified people than harry out of the whole of starfleet to be the new operations manager 
7109,startrek,you have to remember that in any entertaining story they have to skip the uninteresting parts it s possible that data did have a similar experience but it was nt particularly challenging for him so they did nt bother to tell that story instead the show focuses more on data s struggle with basic human interactions 
7110,startrek,holy shit  you got through season five fast 
7111,startrek,am i the only one who remembers this  i ca nt seem to find a video of it anywhere so i m beginning to wonder if my brain invented it 
7112,startrek,imagine that the enterprise was a starship of the confederate space service  that the crew was ethnically homogeneous except for its executive officer  the first halfcaucasian  halfblack person in the fleet then the line reads     of all the souls i have encountered in my travels  his was the most  voice breaks  white    it s the truest and most heartfelt tribute captain kkkirk would know how to give 
7113,startrek,this was  already posted     <URL>  and they re really more like optolythic data rods  not isolinear chips 
7114,startrek,yes but spock was in a box kirk could say whatever made him and the others feel good about the loss of their friend 
7115,startrek,it might be that the bridge officers test is something specific for officers and personnel that are not on a command  operations  or science track since troi and crusher are the only two we have canonical evidence of having taken the test  it might be one of many additional certifications an already commissioned officer can study and attain  analogous to how cadets at starfleet medical academy can take engineering extension courses  and likewise  crusher and troi s rank and promotions  as officers separate from the standard officer track  their promotion to commander should probably be considered differently as a medical rank and is not really analogous to a commander in command  operations  or sciences 
7116,startrek,caroline dhavernas  because i love her
7117,startrek,gina torres would be an excellent captain or xo
7118,startrek,i have nt watched any of his shows  but i would love for jeffrey combs to be on the show in some capacity 
7119,startrek,lee pace and chi mcbride were pretty great in pushing daisies chi mcbride would make a pretty good engineer lee did the villain thing in guardians he d make a great recurring bad guy 
7120,startrek,it s fairly well known that bryan fuller likes to bring over actors from his previous shows    <URL> here s a cool run down of some of the actors who have appeared on multiple fuller shows  so there s a pretty good chance that some actors on that list or others who were on hannibal are going to show up on the new trek who would you like to see on the show 
7121,startrek,i do nt want eddie izzard on the show all the time  but i d like him on the show sometimes he could be the new harry mudd  or the new face of q  something like that 
7122,startrek,jewel staite and gina torres  because firefly of course  jewel also because she had her time in space sf show once  space cases and i really hated how her character ended 
7123,startrek,i had a very geordi valentines 
7124,startrek,where s worf 
7125,startrek,whowhat is it that q is with 
7126,startrek,levar burton talked about this on the nerdist podcast a while back basically the writers in his opinion did nt know how to write about a black man s sexuality in a nonstereotypical way everyone  including the android got to have sex at some point  but not geordi  worf does nt count because he s an alien and not michael dorn 
7127,startrek,i ve seen it stated that into darkness is the worst of the star trek films although i was annoyed they used the same villain for a third time and redid scenes from the wrath of kahn  seriously  no one could come up with a unique script    but i recently rewatched star trek  the motion picture and star trek 5  the final frontier  and to me they still seem way worse than into darkness  what are your thoughts 
7128,startrek,star trek v is considerably worse  that said  the director of this film rehashing a previous popular film in a franchise seems to be a recurring trend  some of the criticism of into darkness does seem to come from individual political opinions rather than actual constructive cinema critique again  curious given the next film the director worked on 
7129,startrek,the worst thing about into darkness was that it undermined itself why go to all the trouble of  rebooting  star trek when you re just going to rehash older and better movies  i m not sure where i stand regarding whether into darkness or tmptff  v  are worse movies into darkness is  thrilling  where v has a tendency to be a bit talky  but it s ultimately a mile wide and an inch deep it just rehashes old ideas and old plots while tmp and tff at least try to bring new  ish  ideas to the table  i would give the edge to the motion picture and the final frontier 
7130,startrek,i think the hate for into darkness is overblown  is it a rehash of wrath of khan  yes is it as good as the original wrath of khan  no  can i understand why they d want to remake wrath of khan  absolutely  star trek ii  the wrath of khan is the best trek film period  wrath of khan is great in no small part because it retreads old trek i remember when it came out fans were worried that general audiences would nt  get  a movie based on an episode of a show that aired decades earlier  this idea that into darkness commits some unforgivable sin because it goes back to the khan well is simply without merit 
7131,startrek,star trek  into darkness has commited the worst crime of any star trek movie ever made  it was entertaining 
7132,startrek,i have nt seen the original movie in so long i do nt feel i can really weigh in on that one  but at least star trek 5 has camp value it s hilarious if you do nt take it too seriously into darkness is just plain bad 
7133,startrek,his love was for that warp core and engineering was his makin sweet love to that ship you could count on laforge to be deep in the belly of the enterprise 
7134,startrek,he can just call up lt uhnari or  holodeck and chill  with leah brahms 
7135,startrek,jadzia  preworf   and why do you think 
7136,startrek,not a single wesley  very interesting 
7137,startrek,since i m not a main character i would most likely die 10 minutes after landing  p but if there was a chance  kira sounds like fun 
7138,startrek,i d go with uhura s green roommate from the 2009 star trek we know she s dtf  and has brought enough men back to their dorm room that she promised uhura that she d stop she would seem like the highest probability for a successful mission 
7139,startrek,tpol  mostly so i have something to stare at 
7140,startrek,kira or dax  jadzia or ezri  really   i d love to talk occupation and resistance movements with kira and she has survival skills i d love to talk about trill sexuality and gender too i m mostly just using this as an excuse to have good conversations though they are both very  very capable 
7141,startrek,7 of 9 need to repopulate the planet 
7142,startrek,as many red shits as it takes to survive two weeks on an uninhabited island  16  to be save  1 for each day and 2 extras as back up   nearly every one of you will be on the receiving end of the  he s dead  jim  line but you re not the one who s going to hear it before you get  that  far with the person your stuck with 
7143,startrek,easy q beatuiful planet ends up putting risa to shame with no worries about running out of supplies  and if things get really down i m just a snap away from a new adventure somewhere else in the galaxy 
7144,startrek,star trek is a television show it s best when we re allowed to stop in weekly and have our perceptions and values checked  all in a nice phaserandwarpdrive wrapper television shows get more leeway there s 24 or so plots in a season  so yeah  we can spend an hour talking about the ramifications of the prime directive  or explore our own sense of hate and prejudice projected on some alien culture with big forhead ridges  in a movie  you ve got on plot you ve got execs breathing down your neck it s a numbers game  and nobody gives a shit about your intriguing plot about a culture that communicates through limmericks or the poignancy of a plot twist that mirrors a current political scandal they want to fill seats  and they do nt give a shit about people who love star trek  cause face it we ll go no matter what 
7145,startrek,stid is probably the most divisive movie to  people  in general nonfans loved it  something i have on good authority from the people who i know that are both movie buffs far more hardcore than i and nonfans of the franchise as a whole   fans hated it  at least  the most vocal fans anyway  i quite enjoyed it despite some apparent flaws   my perception is that stid and st  v have the opposite problems  final frontier has reasonably strong characterization with both the villain and the main trio  while everything else suffers greatly stid  stripped of it s strelated baggage  was actually a very well made action movie  but the characterization of the main trio of characters  with uhura subbing in for mccoy  and the main villain was weak  i ll still take stid and spock s crappy  khaaan  over the fan dance and awful special effects of final frontier though  any day of the week and while sybok seemed like a more nuanced villain  what he lacked was any ability to project the menace and sense of danger that a good villain should  something that khan  for the character s flaws  managed to do quite well  as for the people who complain about  magic blood  and some of the film s seemingly sillier embellishments we re talking about a movie based on a show that featured space greeks  space nazis  guntoting space romans and space lincoln next to that  giant blackops ships  cryogenics torpedoes and magic blood is downright tame 
7146,startrek,i loved motion picture  its obviously slow  but there s a very classic 70s sci fi retro feel to it the modelmaker in me loves the enterprise montage  as well as the intro to the klingon ships in the beginning  st 5 is also plain bad  but like someone else said  its pretty campy  and if you suspend belief its not too bad st  id was just terrible there s nothing fun about it  it takes itself too seriously  is not faithful to its own plot and is terribly derivative in overtly fanpatronizing ways its basically everything that we all hope star wars viii is not 
7147,startrek,tmp is a masterpiece of cinema and final frontier is severely overhated into darkness is far worse than either of them 
7148,startrek,tpol all the way she s ridiculously competentand also other things 
7149,startrek,tom paris 
7150,startrek,if you can get to her first   kamala     <URL>  the metamorph
7151,startrek,bashir what a cool cat 
7152,startrek,are you serious  data does nt eat  or sleep can fix any problem that should arise knows what i can and ca nt eat  can entertain me for days while watching you guys try awkwardly and fail at hooking up with these various star trek ladies  i d be living the high life with a drink in my hand and a coconut radio thanks to my man data 
7153,startrek,neelix  i d kill him for food in case the replicator does nt work    or   you   know    even   if   it   does 
7154,startrek,my logical answer would be q  snap  my pervert answer would be tpol 
7155,startrek,riker smart  strong  resourceful and i m pretty sure we could find some way to pass the time 
7156,startrek,so  if we need to fix a radio or something to get rescued  i d be thinking obrien or data  but if we re talking about dirty survival  i m going with neelix yeah  i ll probably be pissed off and miserable the whole time  and constantly thinking about killing him but neelix is a survivor that s a guy who s been in numerous survival situations  keeps a positive attitude  knows how to deal with water scarcity  and knows what you can and ca nt eat even if it tastes like crap  so  yeah  neelix 
7157,startrek,yeoman colt  because hot redhead with  unusually strong female drives  
7158,startrek,if you re an archaeology geek  daniel jackson is the only pop culture archaeologist out there who is nt basically just a grave robber 
7159,startrek,vulcan was occasionally referred to as vulcania and its people as vulcanians in tos  you would imagine that humans had their own names for stars before they encountered any natives it s not canon but generally agreed that vulcan is 40 eridani  for instance 
7160,startrek,there was earth  but most of the aliens were named after their planets although  i have heard other fans speculating that the reason why we have that naming system was because of the universal translator just translating the names to that 
7161,startrek,i ve given some thought to how the <URL> show can return to the original spirit of gene roddenberry s vision while still looking to the future   what the show needs to be  quite simply  everything that the jj reboots are not  and everything that tng  ds9 and voyager are   the scene amp  what i think would make a dynamic crew  1  the timeline should be the original tog  tng  voyager  ds9 timeline  2  the show should start 100 years after the end of tng this way meaningful references can be made to prior shows and it would nt feel like a totally different universe  3  the ship should be the enterprise assuming that after tng there were 2 other enterprises this show will start on the 3rd enterprise following tng  4  the captain should be a black earth woman  with a strong moral center  5  the first officer should be a human male with a  trip  type personality from the enterprise show probably from the american south  somewhere like louisiana  6  the science officer should be a female vulcan  7  there should be a new generation of male datatype droid on the crew as one of the helmsmen  <SMILE>  one of the other main helmsmen should be a female andorian  9  the tactical officer should be a japanese male  with strong cultural ties to ancient samurai  10  the ship counselor should be something like a male yogi  or a buddhist type personality  11  the chief medical officer should be a female cardassian  with a male human assistant a human emh program should make periodical appearances also  12  the chief engineer should be a russian male  get an actual russian actor who speaks fluent english    the universe since tng  ds9  discarding all the extended universe  wiki stuff  a la star wars   1  cardassia has joined the federation after it s destruction at the end of ds9 they have committed to rebuilding their society as a peaceful  antiwar civilization  2  after their ruin while fighting the dominian war  the klingon empire has struggled to rebuild they committed to a huge armament buildup program and since ds9 have been fighting to regain their honor they are seen throughout the federation as  once mighty warriors  who have lost everything 3  the neutral zone with the romulans still exists and the political situation with the romulans is unchanged since the end of ds9 although the romulans have been slowly expanding on the other side of the neutral zone into new territory the romulans have also formed a temporary alliance with the tholians to fight the klingons in total war of destruction against the klingons the klingons retain most of their territory and are going through a lot of  soul searching   4  the breen have begun active expansion into the gamma quadrant 5  the borg are having difficulty retaking lost territory after their collective was almost destroyed at the end of voyager the borg has developed internal factions fighting for freedom they are not as strong as they once were  but they are nastier and more ruthless than before  6  the gamma and delta quadrants are still largely unexplored  7  after all the conflicts ended with tng and ds9  federation citizens desired an era of peace  which has lasted 100 years so far  something akin to  pax romana  has been taking place for federation citizens  exploration has come to mean conflict and making new enemies and running into trouble  they are simply tired of conflict an isolationist mentality has spread through the land the spirit of starfleet has dimmed there is little political support to help the klingons in their war for survival  but because of the alliance  starfleet must commit at least a minimum of support federation citizens have <URL> apathetic  complacent  lethargic and unmotivated joining starfleet means nothing anymore in the complacency  enemies of the federation have started slowly infiltrating the society  attempting to deteriorate it from the inside by encouraging corruption  petty disputes  political rivalries and a dumbing down of society in general the enemies of the federation are clearly engaged in a secretive divide and conquer strategy   the show  each season would have an overarching theme and title  which would appear next to the episode name  season 1 title should be something like   we were explorers once  the premise  the new starfleet president feels passionately that starfleet needs to be reenergized with a new mission the complacency must end the new enterprise and several other flagships are sent on highly publicized missions of exploration into the gamma quadrant through the bajoran wormhole this new exploration initiative is an attempt to reignite a feeling of nostalgia in federation citizens  a way back to the way things were long ago starfleet calls this the  new frontier project   the isolationists are disturbed by this and protests erupt  even sabotage is attempted the enterprise encounters more nonhumanoid species than humanoids  but most of them are not so warm towards humanoids the enterprise does not understand why all the discrimination against humanoids  season 2 title should be something like   the values we hold dear  the premise  the enterprise is still deep in the gamma quadrant exploring but there is increasing political turmoil back home inside the federation being immune from the happenings back home  the enterprise continues on its interesting mission  but ca nt help being pulled into the political drama once in a while  even being as far away as the gamma quadrant with the help of new  microwormhole detection technology   the crew of the enterprise can make visits to the alpha quadrant in a shuttle pod only once a stable microwormhole is detected meanwhile  while continuing to explore the gamma quadrant  the enterprise continues to find that the gamma quadrant is filled more with nonhumanoid races than humanoids the enterprise discovers that in the gamma quadrant the few humanoid races have created a xenophobic alliance of sorts and discriminate against nonhumanoids nonhumanoids see the humanoids as isolated  scared  angry and primitive  season 3 title should be something like   civil war  the premise  a large splinter faction is seceding from the federation  similar to the american civil war the enterprise must take a side and help to put an end to the conflict in some way battles worthy of  song and story  appear in this season this is one of the darkest hours of the federation since it s beginning in some way  the klingons and romulans are part of this  season 4 title should be something like   fortune favors the bold  the premise  with the civil war ended  the people of the federation have reignited their soul and realized that they either move into the future together  boldly and united  or the entire experiment falls to pieces the people realize that the federation is the only thing preventing the galaxy from plunging into the dark ages of endless territorial wars a new spirit of exploration and peacekeeping is born from the ashes of the destruction at home in a symbol of unity  half of the enterprise crew is replaced with personnel from the former opposing faction the enterprise enters the gamma quadrant  this time  from the other side to explore new territory  and not through the bajoran wormhole the enterprise is having a hard time finding friends in nonhumanoid races due to the prejudice which exists in the gamma quadrant the enterprise decides it s up to them to forge new alliances with nonhumanoids and to break old prejudices  season 5 would be all about exploration with no interruption from federation political drama this season would include an appearance from the borg for the first time  season 6  7 would go from there  a show like this would give us a good mix of exploration  political drama  war  and most importantly the constant testing of federation morals and values 
7162,startrek,all i care about is that it be in the prime timeline and that it be about the enterprise the enterprise is the biggest character of star trek it needs to be at the center of a tv show reboot 
7163,startrek,oddly specific casting it s odd because when i think about my favorite characters in trek  i do nt really think about what gender  race or species they are  but that they re compelling 
7164,startrek,the closest thing to this i recall coming across was still offscreen i remember seeing comments from the cast  crew  or both about walking onto the constitution class bridge  future episode  and marveling at how futuristic it felt  despite being based on the 60s era bridge  there s nothing canon about the tech shift  and we have to accept it if tos was filmed in the current era  it would look different  too  see st2009   in beta canon  the  backwards  feel of tos ships was due to countermeasures to romulan technology you ll see in a future episode of enterprise 
7165,startrek, is what i said to the studio  and they laughed and told me to go write something less trek 
7166,startrek,i think the stories are what matter the details of filming are just the details of filming it would be like asking if there was ever an explanation why all the people in tos look like they re from the 1960s or why the tng crew are super <SMILE>0s i know fashion is cyclical but i do nt think we ve ever brought back fashion from several hundred years ago 
7167,startrek,was informed about it  but i do nt know if i even have 30 dollars for it 
7168,startrek,the older you get the less it hurts 
7169,startrek,where s mr broccoli 
7170,startrek,before answering  i need to know if we tested warp 10 engines before crashing into the planet 
7171,startrek,the only answer is mads mikkelson as ship s counselor  d
7172,startrek,raul muthafuckin  esparza  he was so great on  hannibal  and is pretty much the only reason svu is still watchable he s an extremely talented stage actor as well  he plays asshole characters very well  but can also be sympathetic when called for i could very easily see him excelling at a garaktype character  if the new show has one 
7173,startrek,  <URL> not on mine  trek is nowhere in the trending now category for me 
7174,startrek,interesting i just starting a rewatch of next gen this week 
7175,startrek,do nt trust any such things with netflix all their trending  rating etc is very subjective same movie that has 4 red stars in my profile has 2 in my so s profile 
7176,startrek,where are you getting this from  i m just curious to see because i did nt know you can tell what shows are the most watched 
7177,startrek,yes  i can confirm  but the trending changes based on what you watch  and i watch a lot of star trek 
7178,startrek,netflix usa has star trek and x files  oh come on  sitting in germany waiting for the good stuff to finally arrive 
7179,startrek,    
7180,startrek,remember that time when geordi made that sex hologram of that engineer  then later the real engineer found the sex hologram of her  hahaha
7181,startrek,i wish netflix canada had voyager  and ds9   all we have is tng  the tng movies and into darkness 
7182,startrek,damn hk netflix 
7183,startrek,i would have liked to have seen picard with vash    <URL>
7184,startrek,i am on a trek binge lately finished enterprise a week or so ago and started voyager right after i am currently on season 2 ep 4 
7185,startrek,tng was first on my trending now  list earlier 
7186,startrek,lol im lauhging at some of the comments  thank you guys  i didnt expect to be so upvoted  
7187,startrek,i wish i could confirm it  but there s no star trek at all on aussie netflix 
7188,startrek,i started watching the original series on hulu
7189,startrek,last night i did see tng was in the trending now category but i did nt notice the position 
7190,startrek,i m starting to get the feeling that the socalled  now trending  section is more like suggestions to watch i ve been watching a lot of standup recently and damn near all of the titles in the now trending section are standups as well can anyone else confirm this type of thing happening to them 
7191,startrek,you re gon na get sued 
7192,startrek,i m nearing the end of enterprise and i m about to get into original star trek territory 
7193,startrek,i would suspect that  trending now  is built based on looking at what other users that match your viewing habits are watching i would nt think it represents some global behavior of all netflix users but i do nt work for netflix so i ca nt be sure of that  just positing that perhaps seeing those on your  trending now  might not be that significant  sincerely  richard nixon
7194,startrek,its my flatmate he has been watching that shit hard for a month just him 
7195,startrek,why does nt troi get real eyes 
7196,startrek,your forgot my favorite tng romance  westley and robin from  the game  
7197,startrek,it amuses me to no end that so many fans moan and complain trek shows and films that take a more action heavy approach while at the same time crapping all over tmp because it was too slow and too  boring   i used to have the same mindset  i always enjoyed tmp but when i was younger  i was more likely to pop the star trek ii or star trek vi tape in the vcr this changed when i actually sat down and really payed attention to the film i put aside my misplaced expectations of what i thought it was supposed to be and actually looked at it for what it is  at the end of the day  tmp is probably as close to the true spirit of star trek that we will ever get in a film it was not afraid to be a bit slow if it meant that we could really understand the scale of what was happening it does have some pacing issues but the overall plot of the film  the basic ideas of it  really worked  now  perhaps it gets a lot of flak because it has a jarringly bad color pallet  the pastel uniforms were never a good idea  but i suspect that a big part of the dislike it gets is down to how the characters were handled people go into it expecting the status quo of the tos crew to be unchanged but this film took a different tack  it showed us a crew that had not been around each other for a while  a crew that felt a bit cold and distant because that is _exactly_ what they were supposed to be like in the story  as far as star trek v goes  i generally find that it was poorly executed and severely underfunded but the basic idea is very true to star trek in fact  i think it really captures of the tos episode feel really well and that alone is worthwhile to me the final frontier is a film that stumbles a lot but i do nt think it has earned much of the arbitrary hate it receives  into darkness is a different case like the 2009 reboot  it was made by someone with only a surface level understanding of trek and it shows it tries to take on a challenging contemporary topic  911  justification for war  corrupt military leadership  but the execution of those ideas felt hollow  as if such details were a waste of time that was better spent on action scenes  the action was also a issue i have no issue with action in trek but only if it supports the story and characters i found the reboot and into darkness took the opposite approach and instead constructed thin  weak stories just to support the action scenes i suspect a lot of interesting dialogue was cut in favor of pushing ever forward towards the next shootout or fist fight as if that is the goal of trek alone  finally  into darkness is kinda tragic in that we actually did see some inkling of what it could have been with kirk s character we see hints of what could have been a more developed plotline where circumstances push him to grow past the aggressive character we are introduced to in the 2009 reboot we got parts of that but it was just too little when compared to the kinda mindless action scenes  into darkness was a decent and kinda slick action film but not much else  it lacked the substance that one should expect from a trek story 
7198,startrek,darn  there s a typo in the title should be  origin  not  original  
7199,startrek,the enterprise  1701d  uses 24 hour days as opposed to ds9 s 26 hour day  the crew operates in three <SMILE> hour shifts except when jelico took over and changed it to a 4 shift rotation there was ab episide that referenced a night shift commanded by data but i personally like  this noncannon night crew better     <URL>  v  g4apqrbhqp<SMILE>  
7200,startrek,mine is    1 the next generation   2 deep space nine
7201,startrek,troi pretty sure we could survive for 2 weeks between the two of us she could sense how pathetic and desperate i am and hopefully throw me some sympathy action 
7202,startrek,dr crusher  she s beautiful  knows how to figure out what can and ca nt be eaten andor used as medicine  is tougher than she looks  and practices klingon mokbara  meaning she d be capable in a fight should the need arise 
7203,startrek,i m complaining with bones i need someone who will properly commiserate with me 
7204,startrek,i enjoyed the stargate series theres enough content  10 seasons in sg1  5 seasons in atlantis  2 seasons in universe and a number of movies  to keep you entrenched for a while 
7205,startrek,about battlestar  why do you feel it s a mockery of the genre  did you start at the beginning  im not contesting you  it s just such a different opinion than my own 
7206,startrek,babylon 5 features the first episodic use of cgi in a serialized tv program instead of scale models  so while the effects  dont start out  very good  it is interesting to actually watch the artistic techniques of modern cgi develop before your eyes the first season s art is terrible  but by the third season the art reallys pick up for the big space battles  my personal favorite is where they realize movingcamera shots improve the quality of even bad cgi 
7207,startrek,so these are comedies but have you seen red dwarf and hyperdrive by the bbc 
7208,startrek,my thoughts are that although stid is a slicker and bettermade movie than v and tmp  from the standpoint of action scenes  special effects  pacing  stuff like that  and although v and tmp have lots of problems  and although v has lots of problems  they both take on much more interesting themes and v understands the soul of star trek characters better than stid as cheesy and full of failure as v is  nothing in stid touches v s big  share your pain  scene  stid disappointed me most of all  though  for being a post911 example of how our imagination has shrunk it used to be we looked up at the stars and imagined impossible new things  like vger or even a planet with god on it  as hokey as that was in v  but with stid it s like kirk and spock have been reduced to homeland security duty and we re supposed to think terrorism is the most fascinating possible issue 
7209,startrek,i d go with jim he d be a heck of a friend to know 
7210,startrek,leeta 
7211,startrek,tas got no love 
7212,startrek,i have tickets to my local showing should be pretty cool 
7213,startrek,yeoman rand 
7214,startrek,i m going to go with ezri dax she has all the knowledge and life experience of judzia  but she is nt as sure of herself which makes her infinitely more gettable  judzia is way out of my league  but ezri i think i would have a shot if given a couple weeks alone 
7215,startrek,keiko dunno why but i just have a good feeling about it 
7216,startrek,if you do nt like the new bsg i m not really sure what to <URL> to you now  by the end bsg was horrible but that first season of bsg is one of the finest pieces of science fiction i think i ve ever seen  firefly is amazing dollhouse less so but still a very high quality show both very good science fiction  but  if you re looking for <SMILE>0 s scifi like dune or space mutiny i m not sure they re going to scratch your itch 
7217,startrek,worf i prefer strong leadership during stressful situations and silence the rest of the time plus  if some large dangerous predator come along  well worf  is  basically a large dangerous predator  so dinner is taken care of 
7218,startrek,yes
7219,startrek,for reference  the uss enterprise  cvn 65 had a crew compliment of about 4600 service members and officers  the uss enterprise  ncc1701 had a crew compliment of about 430 
7220,startrek,deanna troi and seven of nine  and why do you think 
7221,startrek,dr selar  she s a doctor  which should help greatly if either of us is injured she s a vulcan  and would undoubtedly help come up with a way to make the situation better  and those are the only two reasons 
7222,startrek,sisqo  because he s a good cook and we can talk baseball also he makes funny noises when he burns his feet on the sand 
7223,startrek,janeway we could have had a nice little life on that planet 
7224,startrek, this guy     vignette2wikianocookienetmemoryalphaimages66aantedean_dignitaryjpgrevisionlatest  cb  20121126173006amp  pathprefix  en  and a sack of potatoes i m going to need a good supply of fish and chips on the beach of that m class planet 
7225,startrek,i did nt like how heavily id aped twok  but i still enjoyed it as a movie spock s  khaaaann    was pretty <URL>  though i mean it made sense to have spock crack and fly off the handle  he s lost his mum  his whole planet blew up  the federation is on the brink of war with the klingons  his commanding officer died during a mind meld with him  he s betrayed by a highranking officer and the ship he s on is getting smashed to shit  oh and yeah  his best mate just died in front of his face  if spockprime went through all of that he d be fuckin  pissed as well i mean shit  in st6  all that happened was his protege betrayed him and tried to start a war he was angry enough to smash a phaser across the room and then basically   mindrape   her  in public  no less  i liked peter weller as admiral marcus he did a great job benedict cumberbatch as khan was fucking stellar and do nt give me this shit about  whitewashing  the character  ricardo montalban was a mexican spaniard in brownface the first time he showed up  and in twok they were nt even bothering  he was just a white dude 
7226,startrek,you ll miss a few references but the other shows are not necessary in fact  if you watch ds9 first  worf reappearing on the enterprise will be confusing  especially in nemesis 
7227,startrek,can you  yes  will you miss out on some minor references in each one  with the exception of generations   yeah granted those references are nt major plot points  they do serve to tie together the larger universe
7228,startrek,at least two people in a red shirt this greatly increases my chances of survival 
7229,startrek,so glad you can fast forward exactly to where you do nt have to hear it every time sometimes though it s nice to hear 
7230,startrek,riker becausewell  let s just pretend i wrote something thoughtful here and not pervy 
7231,startrek,anyone with the dax symbiote so much knowledge and great stories to tell 
7232,startrek,7 for reasons also she is smart and might be able to help us survive 
7233,startrek,nobody say anything  they ll just use it in the next episode of big bang theory 
7234,startrek,in some of the novels  in the romulan language  romulus is called chrihan and remus is chhavran  and the romulans are the rihannsu  memory alpha 
7235,startrek,stick with babylon 5 it s worth it farscape sg1 clone wars and rebels if you like star wars 
7236,startrek,well  that was a little trip down memory lane i used to have this 
7237,startrek,i think they ve generally agreed to adopt the native names of planets and the indigenous species of most of the planets 
7238,startrek,i love them both  but watch them separately 
7239,startrek,probably an artifact of the worries about cbs taking them off streaming  so people are burning through that s what i did with ent the last two weeks 
7240,startrek,gt  outside of kronosqonos the klingon homeworld was also referred once as  kling  in the tng episode  heart of glory   when one of the rebel klingons referred to the imperial government as  the traitors of kling  
7241,startrek,man we used to play this a lot as kids i still have the same problem where i run out of time  
7242,startrek,trust me  if you try to watch them simultaneously  it ll only make voyager look even worst and you ll drop it after a while to concentrate on ds9 
7243,startrek,if you liked our podcast last week  i wanted to let you know that we have not one  but two episodes for you this week the first is our usual review of episode 2 the second episode is a special review of the william shatner documentary  chaos on the bridge   which  many are aware  deals with the behindthescenes drama of star treks resurrection with the next generation check us out   itunes     <URL>  mt  2   soundcloud     <URL> 
7244,startrek,i ve been going through the entire franchise in broadcast order  just finished ent yesterday   and i actually quite liked breaking them up for one thing  voy has a very rough patch later in s2 into s3  and its a slog to get through  but there are some strong ds9 episodes around then  so you always have something to look forward to moreover  ds9  while it engages with serialization  is nt quite as tight as its reputation  and because of budget issues  big stuff happens at the beginning and end of seasons  and then there s a lot of sitting around with characters worrying about how things are going to fall out that all feels more reasonable if you re not watching one right after the other  there are also a couple very minor crossovers they wo nt be a big deal if you miss them  but they re kind of neat 
7245,startrek,i kinda liked how voyager handled it with janeways semimeta  selfdeprecating jokes about it 
7246,startrek,i would watch ds9 and voy separately because there is almost zero crossovers and watching them separately may dilute your experience especially with ds9 and its great character development and story arcs that is unparalleled by any other series 
7247,startrek,once manny coto took over as showrunner  you could see certain aspects of the show s aesthetic begin to look a bit more like tos the bridge became more colorful  the transporter pad became groovier  when manny coto did an ama  i asked him if one could assume from these changes that  had the show continued  the sets and costumes would have grown to resemble tos even more  and he said yes  that he had intended to gradually make ent look more like tos  since the show was canceled  we never got to see the full transition  but it was planned 
7248,startrek,do any of the planet names or people change depending on one s native language  i do nt recall anyone ever mentioning this topic in the show outside of kronosqonos  i ca nt remember any differences in planet names when they are mentioned it s always just vulcan  betazed  ferenginar  bajor  etc 
7249,startrek,90s was indeed a great era for scifi  stick with b5 i agree the effects did nt age well  but the stories and characters are fantastic and keep getting better until around the end of season 4 they did get bigger budgets after a while  seaquest  tng on a submarine   stick to the first season  space above and beyond  space marine fighter pilots made by some of the guys behind the xfiles  exosquad  animated show  but a damn good one sadly only the first of two seasons has been released on dvd  but i think you can find most episodes on youtube 
7250,startrek,do they have a similar clock to us  is the crew all on the same clock  does the crew have a night shift  does everyone sleep at the same time  within reason 
7251,startrek,captains chair was better you could virtually tour the bridge of og  d and e enterprise  voyager and defiant  you could fire a torpedo  set a security lockout or even set self destruct  it was a horrible low res quicktime vr but i loved it 
7252,startrek,the dti books by chris l bennett are definitely worth reading 
7253,startrek,but my time is finally near  i love that song let s make some earl grey and put that sucker on a repeat loop 
7254,startrek,ai nt no party like a ds9 party
7255,startrek,first time viewer  so far gotten through tos  tas  films 15 and four seasons of tng  is ds9 better watched with voyager or separately 
7256,startrek,i always felt enterprise did a pretty good job of showing just how primitive the ship was compared to later series  they have real primitive sensors  incredibly weak phase cannons  against anything with shields they seem to be pretty ineffective  and photon torpedoes  even weaker spatial torpedoes  no shields  and no tractor beam they did nt even have automatic doors for gods sake  there is no in universe explanation  the only reason is that enterprise was made in the 2000 s  while tos was made in 1960 s on a limited budget they could nt make a modern show look like something made in the 60 s  spoilers for later in the series   the tos enterprise is significantly more advanced than the nx class in the mirror universe episode in season 4 they show a constitution class just shred the nx class in combat   spoiler 
7257,startrek,i think it s got to do with how the line of command works  troi and doctor crusher were both medicalline officers  and so they did nt automatically have authority over people outside of their departments except in medical and psychological matters  there was probably some starfleet regulations which made it that medical officers could nt be put in command unless they demonstrated to the captain or the xo that they were capable of it  i do nt think this was as big a deal for officers in the engineering  operations or security departments over the course of their careers  they were more likely to be put in charge of away teams or small teams to do things onboard so  over the course of the years  they d gain experience commanding small numbers of people and would eventually be allowed to command larger numbers of people  even wesley was put in charge of a science group for that one episode  i m thinking it was called pen pals  i might be wrong   this was because he was being trained for a commandline position in the long run chances are that  had he chosen to stay in starfleet  he would nt have had to take the same kind of command test that troi had  or if he did  it would have only been a formality  this was nt really the case for people in the medical department they were stuck doing medical work in sickbay for the most part because that was their job  i think the command test was probably designed mostly for people from the medical line who decided they wanted command of a ship eventually the promotion to full commander was probably just an honourary thing  and did nt automatically put them in the ship s line of command unless the captain decided that would be the case  the real test for people who wanted to gain their own command would be the kobayashi maru test  or something similar to it even for someone who d been in the command line their entire career  it s hard to know how they re going to respond to that kind of situation unless they re tested for it  so they give them the simulation  the test troi took would probably have been considered a kobayashi maru for people in the medical line 
7258,startrek,i remember the day i looked up deforest kelley and realized i was older than he was when he started  star trek   i felt so old 
7259,startrek,i wish he had made some effort to act like the original scott instead of just giving his mission  impossible character a scottish accent 
7260,startrek,what does simon pegg have to do with star trek 
7261,startrek,it s not actually trending in the way you might be thinking it s just trending with people who watch similar things as you 
7262,startrek,i do or do not like the current theatrical incarnation of star trek  in which simon pegg is cast as the chief engineer of the enterprise  scotty   
7263,startrek,so he doing what jj did  stealing the best parts of st  and not even doing it well then putting it all together with a coat of paint that not st
7264,startrek,i do believe it will be good pegg knows treklore and what fans want  although the first trailer was awful  i expect to be surprised with the next one because  the first trailer was a montage of all action apart from the first 10 seconds  it was hard to get any sort of story from it  he helped write the world s end which was brilliantly laced with subtle metaphors and noend of references to modern culture i hold out hope  refer to    <URL>
7265,startrek,got ta say its semi depressing to think that the young blood in st is a 46 year old i say that not as a critism of him but moreso how overdo we are for a new series 
7266,startrek,fuck you for help ruining st
7267,startrek,remember folks  according to pegg benedict cumberbatch is definitely not khan he promised 
7268,startrek,it s my birthday as well  although my birthday would be more hitchhiker s guide themed this year  
7269,startrek,who knows  maybe there will be a gem in those 200 i do nt expect any  but who knows 
7270,startrek,i got this  data took the test when everyone else was on summer holidays  since  as an android  he does nt really take vacation so he thought he d do something more concrete and useful  d
7271,startrek,there certainly are nt any  nicely designed weapons  compared to the tos era they have underpowered phase cannons  early photons but there s nothing to suggest that their weapons were better than the tos weapons in fact  they eventually have an episode where they outline just how much more advanced the weaponry is in tos  as for the screens  it s true they are slimmer than they were in tos  but the tech is not clearly more advanced the only difference really is that in tos they had to add video images on props in postproduction  while in ent they could just play videos on the little screens they have most of the buttonscontrols in ent are physical props rather than the screen buttons of lcars 
7272,startrek,if i recall the os was cpm  not a custom os and it was quite common in the early days of computers before msdos 
7273,startrek,to me one of the great tragedies of trek is failing to followup on the talosians one of the huge powers in the galaxy and they just do not exist any further after  the menagarie   although there is a reference to general order 4 in  turnabout intruder  
7274,startrek,is it narrated by shatner 
7275,startrek,tldr  however the writer wants 
7276,startrek,the planet might be hostile  i want some noname with a red shirt 
7277,startrek,probably based on their fields  operations officer would be assumed to need some basic bridge command lessons but not so much with the ships counselor 
7278,startrek,you have it wrong the real question is  did the command test come with a  crash  course for starship piloting 
7279,startrek,awwwwwwwwww  wwww 
7280,startrek,it just occurred to me that blind people can cry 
7281,startrek,keiko appears to be looking down at something 
7282,startrek,the best scotty 
7283,startrek,hugh lancie  as a android it s pretty obvious choice he s already played an autistic person  so i can see him really working that angle well 
7284,startrek,i love simon pegg  especially some of his earlier stuff such as spaced but his scottish accent is horrendous 
7285,startrek,fun backstage anecdote  troi was given a standard uniform by the costume department  and only then did the writers start writing her into stories where she got to drive the plot by being competent  dress for the job you want 
7286,startrek,any dabo girl  to fill in my time  will do 
7287,startrek,have no idea what s with people s obsession with her i mean she s a good actor  but there are tonnes of good actors to be considered  in general i think it d be important to avoid casting any fan favorites at this point  it s far better to cast a less well known name for the role  edit  she d make a great klingon  it d be nice if they rebooted the look a little to make them a little less orc like 
7288,startrek,so  new trek  all female command staff 
7289,startrek,geordie was just getting to the good part when quark shut off the suite he d been in there for hours  and was starting to cut into that juicy valentines  day profit
7290,startrek,all it s missing is two space jellyfish 
7291,startrek,set phasers to love me    <URL>  v  5g5qtwg5oo<SMILE>
7292,startrek,who are the two in the picture before georgi s
7293,startrek,should ve had worf surrounded by his dead lovers 
7294,startrek,i thought q fell in love with vash 
7295,startrek,did nt  all good things  suggest he married leah brahms in the future 
7296,startrek,i hope the new series rights this  they could do it in any number of ways set it on the same timeline and have a cameo with he and his family  maybe have his son be on the new ship  leaving it open for the character to pop in from time to time  i felt like star trek  while usually showing us how amazing and civilized the future would be  was saying except in love  where the engineering nerd will still fail to get any action  come on  throw us a bone  
7297,startrek,i wish there was one of barclay and all his holodeck loves there were some they did nt show us i just know it  that dirty boy 
7298,startrek,shoulda been laforge and his warp core 
7299,startrek,well done two thoughts though  1 why is keiko smiling  i do nt remember that episode  2 your riker makes me think of randy quaid 
7300,startrek,why are data and tasha snuggling in the captain s ready room 
7301,startrek,richard armitage would make a good klingon 
7302,startrek,he only needs a book  just take a look  reading rainbow 
7303,startrek,send jewel staite back into space 
7304,startrek,into darkness is not the worst it is  however  the most offensive to fans  from a production standpoint  the film is on point the sets  the uniforms  the effects  the acting is pretty much top notch in my opinion the script is weaker than expected sure  and the redo of wok scenes and lazy plugs like super blood and trans warp beaming are awful i hated the trans warp beaming in the first reboot film too  and thought that was weak the fact that they reused it was awful we expected something more out of this movie  i ve seen every trek film in theatres since generations  and into darkness left me the most disappointed after i left the theatre the 2009 reboot left me curious i thought  hey maybe they have a plan and this could be really cool going forward then into darkness came out and i suddenly realized my beloved trek had been steamrolled over and handled incredibly carelessly  it s a sentiment most fans feel they love trek so when it s mishandled its very frustrating 
7305,startrek,into darkness is nt a bad movie it s a bad star trek movie  if i want to watch wrath of khan  i just need to pop in my dvd and there  do something different  the story is weak and it s very evident when watching the movie  it s not the worse but give any of the previous movies into darkness  budget and i garantee a better movie almost 3x the budget from nemesis  what made wrath of khan and undiscovered country great is the intrigue 
7306,startrek,i m going to say miles obrien he s handy enough to make living on the deserted planet not completely terrible and is very personable and has lots of good stories to tell we could sing louie louie 
7307,startrek,seven cuz of reasons 
7308,startrek,the easy answer is of course data  but i d probably go with picard  so we can repopulate the planet a girl can dream 
7309,startrek,i m going with seven because  well  resistance is futile 
7310,startrek,i d go with sybok so that i d have someone to share my  pain     statictvtropesorgpmwikipubimagessybokjpg  with 
7311,startrek,dr crusher  because when she and i get rescued  i want to look wesley in the face and say  you know what the difference is between your mom and the prime directive    i ve never violated the prime directive 
7312,startrek,q could get you home neelix can find anything to eat to survive on worf can fight anything that attacks you scotty could fix the shuttle hmmmmm got ta be jadzia 
7313,startrek,assuming survival is nt difficult  guinan pleasant to chill with and seems like she d also be cool with letting me introvert off by myself when needed 
7314,startrek,with my luck it would be major kira during the day she would meaninglessly arrange parts of the landscape and during the night she would drone on endless about stuff during the occupation  around day 12 i will decided that one of us is not getting off this planet 
7315,startrek,ensign lefler
7316,startrek,o brian is the only lyrics answer he is the ultimate bro  he s tough as nails  and he can fix anything with nothing 
7317,startrek,tasha yar i like em feisty 
7318,startrek,i ll go with crusher  she has a background in botany and would be able to tell what plants could be edible  or medicinal  not to mention hawt redhead
7319,startrek,bones i know literally nothing about medical stuff  and knowing me i d probably be allergic to everything on the planet and it would be nice having someone equally as grumpy to complain with 
7320,startrek,how is this even a question  mot i might be lonely  but my hair will be on fleek 
7321,startrek,enough redshirts to equal one whole named character
7322,startrek,obrien he can fix a damn shuttle also  if anyone s going to suffer  its going to be him 
7323,startrek,data
7324,startrek,troi  every time she gets into a shuttle  shit gets real 
7325,startrek,well  i was in a shuttle crash so it s almost definitely chakotay that was with me 
7326,startrek,hoshi then i would nt be the biggest basket case on the planet 
7327,startrek,ensign kell perimgoogle pics from  exit to eden   d
7328,startrek,  <URL>
7329,startrek,picard i want to explore some ruins  no not that kind of ruins 
7330,startrek,i smell identity politics  and it reeks 
7331,startrek,evil nympho bitch kira form the alternate reality it d be a rough couple week wink wink 
7332,startrek,data was already trained as a bridge  line  officer  qualified to hold command positions he does nt need to outrank staff officers to be assigned command before she qualified  troi was a staff officer  similar to a military chaplain dr crusher would normally be a staff officer in her position  but she had chosen to broaden her qualifications and passed the test years before  the promotion to commander being contingent on the test is harder to explain dr pulaski was a full commander but was not a bridge officer it s possibly a matter of picard and riker s discretion the writers may have simply contrived the idea that the bridge officer s test was the reason for crusher s and troi s difference in rank  but that does nt really make sense when you think about it 
7333,startrek,hate that damned song 
7334,startrek,the whole time reading the expanse books i imagined her as one of the main characters  naomi  the show did a great job casting  but i still think she would have been great 
7335,startrek,just because of i have glasses does not mean i like star trek  i do love it though dammn it conan
7336,startrek,almost every time i read a memoryalpha article  there s a section that lists some really neat tng setused item that was sold during the  it s a wrap  sale and auction   was anyone on this subreddit fortunate enough to win anything from this auction back during 2006200<SMILE>    <URL>  _sale_and_auction
7337,startrek,i remember leonard nimoy narrated a documentary highlighting some of the big pieces that were going to auction 
7338,startrek,just discovered this list of all the items sold along with their sell price  one of the enterprised ship models sold for over  500000crazy    <URL>  intsaleid  20723amp  viewtype  listamp  action  sortamp  sid  03c1257<SMILE>65a24af5ad4fea3f7d7b4<SMILE>0camp  sortby  ehigh
7339,startrek,i think it s because troi is a counselor  and had no command training in her background 
7340,startrek,i tried bidding on some gold pressed latinum  but all i got was a bunch of selfsealing stem bolts 
7341,startrek,i won a huge case of envy 
7342,startrek,good i love scenes with bones and spock 
7343,startrek,i really think there s a great trek film hidden under that shitty bland blockbuster trailer  simon pegg  avid trekkie  super talented writer and nerd messiah  is writing the script justin lin  tos fan growing up and one of the best action directors in hollywood is helming the film  yes  he s the director of the  fast amp  furious  films  but let s not act like  fast five  and  fast amp  furious 6  were nt very welldirected and two of the best films in the franchise he was able to direct a large starstudded ensemble cast including vin diesel  dwayne johnson  paul walker  michelle rodriguez  among other big names  and should do just as good with this large cast another film of lin s that gets great reviews is  better luck tomorrow   it even has john cho  sulu  in it i think he s a fine choice  i just hope he does nt make some  star trek  the fast amp  furious  type film  i m cautiously hyped there s nothing wrong with a trek action film  the real problem is sloppy mindless writing which i felt into darkness had star trek 09 was nt the most intellectual or thoughtful either  but it was fine for what it was  a fun reboot and origin of the original cast  now it s time to step it up  do nt repeat into darkness  mistakes let s hope they do nt screw it up during the 50th anniversary of all things 
7344,startrek,i m still holding on to hope  though at least in my group of friends were still more stoked for the 2017 series more bones and spock has just got to enter into the scene their interactions were 9th of my series favorite parts of the original series let s not forget who held whose katra 
7345,startrek,i love a couple of pegg s movies  but not anything he s got to say about or his work on star trek
7346,startrek,nice  looking forward to it
7347,startrek,it took them three movies to go that route okay 
7348,startrek,yeah i got a bunch of items what do you want to know 
7349,startrek,god  i really hope so i actually really enjoy karl urban as bones and would love for him to get more screen time  and for it to expand on the differences between him and spock  speaking of spock  i like quinto as spock  i do but jesus do i hate what they ve done with him so far and i absolutely hate the fact that uhura has done nothing but be a bit of a stereotype in the sense that it s all about their relationship and feelings and blech  yea  i want characters to have relationships  ups and downs  etc  but did they have to make her be such a chick flick kind of character in the reboots 
7350,startrek,in  alliances   during the scene when all the kazon leaders enter the room for their big meeting  there are sound effects of somewhat silly ceremonial horns and an audience whistling and clapping as each one enters  i would be willing to say the horns are just part of the background music  or perhaps being provided by some kazon bugle boy off screen  but the clapping  there is nobody else in the room other than the voyager crew members the voyager members are seen during the moments we hear the clapping and they are clearly shown to not be the source of it  is the clapping supposed to be some prerecorded stock footage sound effect the kazon leaders play over hidden speakers whenever they enter a room together  just kind of seemed odd to me  made me feel like i was watching a <URL> for a minute 
7351,startrek,it s interesting  people claim it only exists on the streaming version 
7352,startrek,i remember that scene i m pretty sure it was a prerecorded thing for making the kazon leaders look good it goes along with their propensity towards vanity and egocentric behavior 
7353,startrek,no one knows it only exists in the netflix version some have speculated that it s from an early cut of the episode that was never aired and that somehow netflix got a copy of this cut and not the final version 
7354,startrek,i have the dvd version  it s not in there 
7355,startrek,totally never noticed that before found the referenced scene on youtube    <URL>  v  6um2aot_vl<SMILE>
7356,startrek,of course she speaks klingon she could nt not after seven years playing torres on voyager 
7357,startrek,if she s the next captain  i m immediately behind that she s just a great actress and knowing she loves the franchise makes me want to see what she would do with the role 
7358,startrek,now  i m wondering what the original ears looked like 
7359,startrek,she says two words  but props to her anyway 
7360,startrek,i m having people over for dinner in a few hours and my replicator just shit the bed are there any cardassian grocery stores around where i could find some  i checked whole foods already  but they did nt have any 
7361,startrek,i thought i was on rshittydaystrom for a second 
7362,startrek,how many wrappages do you need  i know a guy  owns a bar on this old cardie station  he can get ya anything romulan ale  klingon aphrodesiacs  tribbles  you name it 
7363,startrek, ask odo     <URL>   he certainly knows where to find it 
7364,startrek,i have been adding to that tng statistic if there is one i plowed through season 2 in two days 
7365,startrek,in the uk we just have a couple of the movies  none of the various series at all   
7366,startrek,surprised he is 46 i think they knocked the ball out of the park with all of their choices to replay kirk  spock  scotty  and mccoy big fan of the original series fist fights  hot ladies  breaking the rules and saving the universe on a binge rewatching all of them on netflix no ads  heaven 
7367,startrek,so why does he look like he s 26 
7368,startrek,so much unstar trek like sentiments here  the man is a big fan  and a major contributor to the recent films  and presumably star trek 2017 happy birthday simon 
7369,startrek,rshittydaystrom
7370,startrek,it was just overlooked  but i suspect data has some kind of backup  chances are they did nt rewrite his entire memory  just wrote some new ones and cut off access to the old memories 
7371,startrek,always liked this episode  though i ve never been comfortable with the idea that there s a race that has the ability to alter the memories of the whole crew of the federation flagship  as well as rewrite parts of data s memory algorithms  but has yet to develop phaser or photon torpedo technology or why they have nt used this memory wiping abilities on their opponents
7372,startrek,i ll say hb to mr pegg  but i do not like his portrayal of mr scott 
7373,startrek,quick recap  a mysterious ship scans the enterprise  everybody s memories are selectively wiped  actually just blocked   data s memory is similarly unavailable  and the ship s computer memory banks are firewalled off to be almost useless dr crusher devises a brainstimulation treatment to restore the crew s memories  but an alien infiltrator  cmdr macduff  fakes a seizure to prevent them from using it eventually the enterprise crew exposes macduff s plot  everything unravels in the last few minutes of the episode  and it s explained in exposition that they used dr crusher s brain stimulator to restore the crew s memories  question  nobody mentions poor data s fate at the end of that episode his memory appears to be fine  but i assume the medical treatment could nt be applied to him so how was his memory restored   did i overlook something  or did the writers just sort of hurry past that and hope we would nt notice 
7374,startrek,ironically i did nt remember this episode 
7375,startrek,for the greater good
7376,startrek,also known as the  starfleet technical manual  by franz joseph published 1975  isbn 0345340744
7377,startrek,well  that was actually pretty cool 
7378,startrek,this might be my new favorite ad of all time
7379,startrek,i really do nt understand  there has to be some device capable of passive reads on magnetic storage  from which they could make disk images  those disk images could be ran through the same algorithms we use in flash storage today  flash storage is nt tested  bad data areas are fixed with a chip as powerful as a pc from 1995 that just runs data correction algorithms on the fly as your device accesses the sd card   we could fill in any time and wear related holes that way  then we have the disks as images  which we could put into a cpm vm and access or if the filesystem can be accessed as a block device in linux  extracted as files  if it really is lotus for cpm  i would nt be surprised if the last version of lotus would be able to open it if it is  copy pasting it to notepad or another word processor like word would be simple  edit   linux supports cpm file systems     linuxdienetman5cpm 
7380,startrek,my glasses just exploded 
7381,startrek,this is going to suck 
7382,startrek,well  they re a warrior race and aesthetically lady klingons probably dug dude klingons with the toughest looking forehead also perhaps many years before  like klingon cavemen times  they literally attacked each other with their foreheads 
7383,startrek,there are different crests  for different bloodlines 
7384,startrek,they are sort of evolutionarily evolved from their equivalent of simians who butt heads to fight for dominance like terran rams the custom continues today when klingons go out and celebrate with drinking  they butt heads and laugh  much like terrans bump chests 
7385,startrek,family members all have similar crests  for one 
7386,startrek,i completely misread this post as  headrests   and i was trying to go through images of the chairs in the klingon ships to look at their headrests 
7387,startrek,kyamo
7388,startrek,just talking with an individual that is a newbie to the star trek fandom and got asked this question i was unable to provide any answer that gave them any meaning at all 
7389,startrek,the spockbones friendship is my favorite star trek friendship always busting each other s balls  but deep down you know they like each other 
7390,startrek,the spock and mccoy bantering and bickering was one of the best things about tos completely opposing personalities only reigned in by the captain 
7391,startrek,wait  are nt these three recent films ment to be situated after stng 
7392,startrek,i still have very little faith in this movie i d love to be proven wrong  but i highly doubt it 
7393,startrek,according to simon pegg  cumberbatch was nt playing khan  i like the man and his work immensely  but he does nt have the best track record 
7394,startrek,literally just finished watching the episode and chuckled about the silliness of the applause especially the moment when the audience goes crazy for culluh 
7395,startrek,just off the top of my head  i think it would be interesting to find a selection of the episodes  scenes or even ideas that people really loved and then delve into the origin of them who pitched that idea  what response did it get from those in charge  how did it change between the pitch and the screen  how did everyone feel about the final product 
7396,startrek,early design stages of the iconic ships  species  and sets 
7397,startrek,i m working on developing a star trek documentary  but there are already a few out there i wanted to know if there s anything that die hard fans have yet to learn about the show and its history  what would you like to see covered 
7398,startrek,deep space nine  to me anyway  the conception  execution and internal reception of deep space nine is something i do nt know much about  and what i do is mostly hearsay  unlike all the other shows  the cast were nt that friendly amongst each other  terry farrell left because rick berman did nt give her a pay rise because he did nt think she was a good actor  etc   supposedly gene hated the idea of it being on a station shortly before he died it was always treated as the red headed stepchild by paramount  and yet it s almost consistently everyone s favourite trek show but despite that there is nt 110th the audiovisual material about it that tng or even enterprise has  for a show which served as the prototype for much of modern genre television there s shockingly little about how it came to be and how it was made 
7399,startrek,concerning voyageri would like to know more about how the studio interfered with the writer s vision we have heard  for example that the writers wanted more conflict between the two crews but upn nixed the idea i d like too know if that is true and the full extent of their oversight 
7400,startrek,what are they setting us up for 
7401,startrek,the guy also has a  blog     <URL>  with a number of renders of voyager and other ships if you go searching through  linked is my favourite post
7402,startrek,looks like hd transfer to me  instead of rerendering but then  the fb video is lowres enough to not be able to tell the difference 
7403,startrek,i thought it had something to do to focus the audience s attention to the  supposed  popularity of the mahge being announced maybe  them trying to psychologically affect the captain 
7404,startrek,are those cardassian ships made out of legos  and could we please get more ships in one shot  because you know  space is not that big 
7405,startrek,it really bad  and funny   but not as bad  and funny  as the rocks flying around whenever there is an explosion inside the ship 
7406,startrek,i think the problem is there is so much of those scenes missing though 
7407,startrek,hi everyone  i m a long time trekkie and an occasional podcaster in my podcast bold signals i interview scientists and the occasional nonscientist about the lived experience of doing science anyway  i interviewed les johnson the technical adviser for nasa s advanced concepts office for the  most recent episode     <URL>   our conversation covers a lot of interesting topics  ranging from what it s like to work for nasa to the tennessee valley interstellar workshop but  most relevant to this subreddit s interests  much of the episode is actually about star trek its influence on our  very different  careers and its reciprocal relationship to the us s current space program i d be delighted if you all checked it out  if you dig the episode  and i really hope you do   you can subscribe via  itunes     <URL>  mt  2    stitcher     <URL>   or listen on  soundcloud     <URL>   incidentally  les is nt  the     <URL>   first     <URL>  to discuss how star trek catalyzed a career in science on the podcast and i m sure he wo nt be the last 
7408,startrek,ok  but what do  more scenes  entail  dialogue or action  kirk and spock had  scenes  in into darkness but they were mostly action sequences i still do nt feel the friendship between these men everyone s at odds with each other anyway they finally got their wish and got rid of gene s  no conflict between the main characters  and now we know why it was there 
7409,startrek,which is really good  but  think about what a star ship requires   navigator  engineer  communications these are the crew the show should be focused on if the intent is to portray humans as they hurtle through our galaxy together in a machine 
7410,startrek, remember 
7411,startrek,i have some  i might be willing to trade  but i need a boat load of self sealing stem bolts 
7412,startrek,canadian tv  folks this brings me back 
7413,startrek,my girlfriend and i enjoy watching 1 or 2 tng episodes before bed i d like to introduce her to and do the same with the other series but do nt necessarily think that there pilots offer a sense of what the series  feels  like any suggestions 
7414,startrek,tos  trouble with tribbles who does nt love tribbles and it has each member of the trio  being themselves as well as a great whodunnit  tng  i d go with measure of a man  it s an extremely strong episode to introduce the sort of moral dillemas that crop up in tng ds9  duet  it s a great early episode that gives an overall impression of the conflict that drives the series  bajorcardassia  as well as being fantastically acted  voy  deadlock  a fantastic episode all around that does nt require previous knowledge and features strong acting from mulgrew and lien  plus has the fun brain puzzle of whether harry kim is on the correct voyager ent  the catwalk is a great character piece  andorian incident is always a good shout as an early episode if they re a doctor who fan though go for future tense
7415,startrek,tos  city on the edge of forever it is a nice character drama that does nt rely on part knowledge and gives a sense of the whole show  ds9  the jemhadar is a good episode to start with does nt rely a huge amount on past character relationships as they are pretty much explained and the episode pretty much summarizes the rest of the series  voy  honestly i d think the pilot simply because it is probably the most solid of all the tng era pilots  but if not that one i would probably say scorpion or eye of the needle  ent  like before probably the pilot  but if we are excluding that then definitely the andorian incident hands down the best episode of the first season 
7416,startrek,the first trek episode i ever saw was arena  at the age of four  and i ve been hooked since then  but i think the devil in the dark might be a better introduction to tos  as for tng  i would go with darmok  and i also have to vote for duet for ds9 it s the first great episode  and the series is quite good from that point on 
7417,startrek,tos  while it s my favorite episode  i would definitely hold off on showing  mirror  mirror  until much later in their watching spectrum maybe even as the last episode too much knowledge of characters to be as meaningful early i would go with  city on the edge of forever  or perhaps the roman one  i ca nt recall the name offhand  
7418,startrek,this might sound strange  but i think the best episode of ds9 to introduce someone who has zero knowledge of the series is  the adversary  it s a quality episode that gives a good introduction to most of the characters  except dax imo   it s action oriented and easily digestible  it shows what the main villains are capable of and why they should be feared  and finishes with the promise of escalating conflict to come it certainly does nt fill in all the backstory  but i think it s the best episode to pique someone s interest 
7419,startrek,in the pale moonlight is the best grab for ds9 gives you an overview of the series  drama packed  some spoilers but nothing specific other than there s a war  voyager is a little harder i d <URL> pre 7of9 and nothing with kazon in it breaking completely from that statement  that episode where they get trapped in a subspace sinkhole and form a federation to escape is pretty cool
7420,startrek,voy  random thoughts  i just watched that again today and it reminded me of the enterprised s journeys so much pretty good introductory episode  i think though it might not represent the rest of voy fully  since it does feel more tng 
7421,startrek,for ds9  i might go with  captive pursuit   the episode with tosk  you get to see them being friendly with a new alien  and then having and resolving a fairly serious disagreement with another alien  and then slightly bending their own rules  and their own points of view  to <URL> everyone 
7422,startrek, its the next generation  on your favorite station  whoever wrote this really outdid themselves
7423,startrek,they attract mates and strike fear into potential rivals 
7424,startrek,jean luc  geordi s specs  mysteries on the holodeck asteroids  trip with droids  telepathic betazoids transporter  deadly claw  visitor from la law photons  no kirk  captain has gone berserk shuttle craft  counselor troi  dr crusher s little boy klingon rites  parasites  new heights  phaser fights data s head  tasha s dead  riker s hanging by a thread  celebration  transformation  everyone to battle stations  we did nt start the series  it s the next generation on your favorite station  we did nt start the series  but when we are gone  it ll still be on  and on and on and on 
7425,startrek,you can make a reasonable copy with crushed tube grubs and some spices serve it with raktajino  it goes great 
7426,startrek,some more    <URL>  v  ijs0hhozfq   <URL>  v  ozwmoi5tyqs   <URL>  v  lwa0ixa7q
7427,startrek,hm  i do nt think that was from the <SMILE>0s 
7428,startrek,i d like to learn more about the lives and folks who built the sets  designed the shipsthe people who were behind the camera 
7429,startrek,the captains typically get a lot of the spotlight  but i d be interested in hearing from the rest of the regular cast members  of any show    how would the actor have wanted their character to develop and progress throughout the series   how did the showrunner or studio react to those ideas  what got implemented  and what concepts became a lost opportunity  path not taken   which episodes contain their best work  which are they most proud of   what storylines or arcs hampered character development  or nudged it in an undesirable direction   if you could meet your past self on set  on the first day of shooting  what advice would you give 
7430,startrek,i would also speak to the other series  ds9  voyager  enterprise  as tos and tng have been covered pretty well and there is no shortage of behindthescenes material available on the dvdbluray sets as well as online for those 2 series  for every other series  the information is typically limited to transcripts of panel discussions or oneoff interviews with stars and writers  at least from what i ve found a wellproduced documentary about ds9  voyager or enterprise would certainly find a market out there 
7431,startrek,so i tagged my friend on the video to show my friend  the author added me on facebook and is now posting strange messages to my wall and via pm   <URL>
7432,startrek,i remember that promolol my local station used it 
7433,startrek,there are four  fucking lights  what else do i have to say 
7434,startrek,it d be an understatement to say fuller s hiring shot my hype meter threw the roof  i m planning to watch the first episode of  dead like me  tonight ca nt wait 
7435,startrek,if you had asked me the day before this announcement who i wanted for showrunner  i would ve said bryan fuller i would ve thought it a total longshot fancasting choice  but i would ve said it he is perfect 
7436,startrek,it gets better before the hair thing imo the finale for season 2 pretty much sets up the rest of the show 
7437,startrek,skip  move along home  if it s not too late 
7438,startrek,yeah by season 4 it gets really good  enjoy the watch through
7439,startrek,you know you could possibly do projections for voy it may be confusing but if you think about it  it s setting up that the ship is lost and what the doctor is  and also what everything is nt if you look at all the stuff that should nt be happening or true of a typical voy episode  it s pretty informative  though i think caretaker is a good enough episode to start with  but let s be real the doctor gets every good episode so why not start with one about him 
7440,startrek,in ds9 episode  progress  nog is bargaining his way through the gmc when a suggested trade for stem bolts land is offered nog stops and cant understand how it might fit within the gmc until jake explains it to him later  is this simply a flaw in nog s understanding of gmc or is there some ferengi understanding of  land  that makes it different than anything else one might bargain for 
7441,startrek,bryan fuller work on hannibal i think will be a great stepping stone for new trek here s the reasons why  1  fuller proved that he can write characters that make convincing professionals this may not seem like a big deal  but writing a convincing doctor  lawyer  psychologist etc is hard to do this is a strong sign that he is able to maintain a certain level of dignity that we ve seen with characters such as spock  picard  data  and mccoy  2  he can mix common denominator topics  blood and gore etc  with higher brow concepts and intermix the two seamlessly time and time again we saw what would be run of the mill slasher plots on the show expand into topics that are far deeper and more complex than they would appear on the surface  3  he is skillful at adapting psychological topics without seeming like he s reading the idea from a wikipedia page whatever the next series will be it d be a huge failure  if massive popularity of psychology was nt voiced more strongly in a series  4  he understands visuals and admits openly that he writes for the camera lens and not for the screenplay considering our expectations for cgi are intensely high  it s great to know that we have a frontrunner that can use cgi to it s maximum effect  i expect to see some real sciency type imagery  5  he s developed a strong set of techniques for shooting on a budget obviously the budget of this show will be very high  however i think it d be great if the budget can be focused on delivering big scale action  and not wasted on filler the fact that he understands how to write huge amounts of dialogue that can be filmed on a single set is a real blessing for the series  6  he s great at writing mysteries even if it s out of details that may appear to be trivial  the guy is a master of revealing and hiding things without seeming like its done for simple shock value  7  this series will be full of villans it s a topic that we all resonate with  gul dukat  q  the borg  tamerlane  khan  general chang the fact that nutrek has worked hard to establish villans only furthers the idea that the series will require some well written villainy  ps he knows how to have fun too  although that is nt from his hannibal experience 
7442,startrek,xpost referenced from rtlhinganhol by ushanoxilt  how to be a klingon male     <URL>         i   am   a   bot   made   for   your   convenience     especially   for   mobile   users      contact     <URL>  to  originalpostsearcher        code     <URL>        faq     <URL>  faq 
7443,startrek,use your ridges to make orange juice lol
7444,startrek,i happen to see the following video where levar burton said he was disappointed cause the new timeline would not have scope for the tng team    <URL>  v  ixckr3o6frc but if khan could have a different origin but was still destined to clash with kirk and team then why is there no scope for tng   edit  i mean the scope for tng in the current reboot series 
7445,startrek,in the nuuniverse  picard has thick curly hair and the crew wear capes and some special safety helmets 
7446,startrek,no reboots  please 
7447,startrek,idk  the ridiculousness of the mirror universe  all these characters were still born and still destined to interact with each other despite the incredibly different timelines   to me establishes a good enough precident for the cast of tng to come together in the nuuniverse 
7448,startrek,i would nt mind seeing tng rebooted after the tos reboot  it is entirely possible in my opinion 
7449,startrek,please no more reboots i want them to leave the existing material alone and come up with a new and original trek movie this trend of rebootingremaking movies has gone on long enough 
7450,startrek,i am new to star trek and this is my first viewing i finished watching tos  loved it   currently watching tng s06 the next step will be ds9 i have one question it seems tng and ds9 were aired simultaneously for 2 years are there any ds9 episodes i should see while watch the last two seasons of tng  i am yet to see any reference to ds9 in tng but then i have just started with tng s06 
7451,startrek,no not really the first episode of ds9 features picard a little and they drop off obrian but there is nothing really important to the plot of tng in ds9 it s definitely not like buffyangel where they would sometimes alternate episodes telling one story 
7452,startrek,there is a tng episode with dr bashir but it really was nt that great 
7453,startrek,do nt worry about it it is safely assumed they are on separate parts of the federation  so to speak   in fact  one of the often raised questions was  where was enterprise during the whole dominion war   and that s partially answered in the novel  battle for betazed  
7454,startrek,is it just me  or is this absolutely  hands down  the best trek game ever made  all the original voice actors  great gameplay and a fantastic story this game definitely needs to get remade in my opinion who agrees 
7455,startrek,this is definitely a pipe dream  but i think bioware should some how find a way to secure the rights to star trek games can you imagine a massive mass effectlike game in the star trek universe  look what they did with star wars  knights of the old republic was epic too trek deserves that sort of treatment
7456,startrek,i would kill for a telltale pointandclick star trek game in the tone of 25th anniversaryjudgement ritesa final unity 
7457,startrek,it does do pretty well when compared to  most  other trek games  it certainly got the basic trek idea down far better than titles like elite force 12  armada  and even stuff like bridge commander  which had the best ship combat but literally nothing else going for it   if there is one thing i am not fond of about a final unity   even when i first played it as a kid   it is that the puzzles were too puzzle like  i always felt like it had some great moments but a lot of the game felt like a fairly generic  and somewhat untrek like  adventure title with a trek coat of paint 
7458,startrek,a remake would seem to be difficult as all of the game s assets were owned by spectrum holobyte who were merged with microprose and then bought by hasbro who then sold the lot to infogrames who have themselves gone out of business since  if anyone owns what s left of the company i would guess it s bandai namco 
7459,startrek, here     <URL>  is the order that they aired  if you want to experience it the same way as we did when it first was being shown to us 
7460,startrek,from what i remember  there are three crossovers with ds9 in tng   the enterprise visits ds9 in  birthright part 1   and dr bashir is a guest character   quark has a cameo in the season 7 episode  bloodlines    the penultimate episode of tng   preemptive strike   features an organisation called the maquis  the formation of which is detailed in ds9  but these are relatively minor things  and it s not worth the effort of alternating between tng and ds9 in order to appreciate them feel free to finish tng before taking on ds9 the same is true for voyager  there s no substantive reason to alternate episodes between that show and ds9 
7461,startrek,it would be easier to watch the entirety of tng before watching ds9 there is one episode of tng where a ds9 character is in it  but any tng crossovers in ds9 are better watched afterward 
7462,startrek,i was never able to play it sadly would love if gog would get that up 
7463,startrek,it was like being in an episode  i hope one day its gets an unreal engine overhaul 
7464,startrek,yes  love this game still have my old cd stored away not only the best st game imo but one of my favorite games of all time i remember all the hours i spent playing this game on my old 4<SMILE>6 computer great story  great vo work i really should dust this bad boy off and revisit my teen years i agree that a remake would be epic but sadly i doubt it will ever happen  
7465,startrek,how does it differentiate itself from  mission log   which is currently doing the same thing and is in the middle of season 4 right now  i do nt have a problem with multiple similar shows  i m just wondering what these people bring to the table 
7466,startrek,i have seen tos and am currently watching tng season 6 thanks to user umhb210 post of selected list of episodes from tng s01 and s02 its been good in general since s03 since the next step is ds9  i am wondering to watch or to skip i have been hearing contrary views online  some say its boring and they could not sit through it  while some say it is the best so i am not sure its 7 seasons long  150 episodes and is going to take a lot of my download bandwidth  while the views are contradictory  most people seem to agree s01 and s02 of ds9 are just as bad as tng 
7467,startrek,gt  most people agree s01 and s02 of ds9 are just as bad as tng  whaaaat ds9 s second season is really good imo that s the season when ds9 really hit its stride  and honestly  while s1 is uneven  and weaker than the subsequent ds9 seasons  i do nt think it s really a bad season by itself the pilot is excellent  and the season also contains one of the defining episodes of the entire series   duet  opinions will vary widely on this  but personally i d even go as far as to say that ds9 season 1 s low point   move along home   is nt nearly as bad as the low points of tng s first season   code of honor    then again  i do nt hate  move along home  as much as some other people do it s dumb  but pretty inoffensive 
7468,startrek,you should have skipped posting this and started ds9 already 
7469,startrek,ds9 is my favorite trek series  and i d definitely say do nt skip it however  if you do nt want to watch 176 hours of it  you can definitely find ways to trim that down i m doing a selected rewatch now since i ve seen every episode a few times  and basically using my own memories and the ds9 rewatch threads on tor as guidelines  anything that gets under a 6  i skip 
7470,startrek,definitely watch ds9 if you like tng it s different but very good 
7471,startrek,thank you all  i have one question it seems tng and ds9 were aired simultaneously for 2 years are there any ds9 episodes i should see before  while i finish my tng viewing  so far i am yet to see any reference to ds9 in tng season 6 
7472,startrek,generally speaking  tos and tng are equal parts technobabble filled particle of the week  mysteries  and deep introspective humanism ds9 is more skewed towards the huminisim  and voyagerent are more skewed towards the technobabble  if you enjoyed watching debates about ethics  and the meaning of life  the universe  and everything  then ds9 might be for you if you just liked turning off your brain and watching cool space stuff  then not so much  having said that  the dominion war has hands down some of the best  most intense action in the trek universe  dominion war also contains a very long  seven season  storyline that involves an incredibly cerebral deconstruction of war amp  duty amp  thing things people do to protect the people they care about imo  it is definitely worth the slog through the boring parts of s1 amp  s2  through the slow build in s3 and s4 to the huge payoff in s5 and s6  when the war breaks out  it is all out no holds barred huge battles between dozens  if not hundreds  of ships are a regular occurrence millions dead tragedy after glorious tragedy  until it culminates in a crescendo of phaser and polaron beams  photon and quantum torpedos  in short  it is pretty epic 
7473,startrek,just watch it all 
7474,startrek,season 1 can be tedious at times but there are some real gems do not miss out on kira heavy episodes  eg past prologue  progress  duet   especially  duet under no circumstances skip duet  or skip any episodes with vedek winn  because louise fletcher is just too good to miss and her character is very important throughout the series   also i find dramatis personae  while sort of predictablestereotypical scifi  shines due to the performances of the actors  especially nana visitor  
7475,startrek,i am going through ds9 for the second time right now  just finishing s2 the first time i hated the first two seasons but this time with the exception of one episode in particular  many people probably know which episode i m referring to  i m really enjoying the first two seasons that being said i feel like you need to watch the first few to understand the rest of the series which is very very good it s different from tng but just as good 
7476,startrek,i ve seen bits and pieces of star trek throughout my life  but recently i decided to do a complete watch of all the series so far ive gotten through tos and tng and just started ds9 as much as i enjoy it  the implementation of the star date really bothers me the main reason is this  each 1000 star date represents roughly 1 year of earth time this is seen both in tos  stardate ranges from 1312 to 592<SMILE> while real years range from 2265 to 2269  and in tng  each season represents 1000 stardate  and there is a lot of dialogue suggesting that 1 season is equal to 1 year   this would indicate that the difference in time between tos  stardate  13006000  and tng  stardate  410004<SMILE>000  should be on the order of 40 years or so  plus or minus a few years however  tng takes place in the 2360 s  which is 100 years after tos  how is this reconciled  edit  this is really too bad i want to like the idea of a star date  but they just implemented it so poorly 
7477,startrek,it s not reconciled the star dates are nt accurate there s really nothing more to it than that 
7478,startrek,i think they initially did this so that they were not tied down to a particular date  but ya  it does get a bit annoying when you are trying to figure out an exact date and they do nt quite line up 
7479,startrek,the most indepth examination which i ve seen into how stardates work  is here     starchivecsumanitobaca  stardates   the tl  dr is that he theorizes that the stardate system began close to the founding of the ufp  and then it ran to 99999 before cycling back over to 00000 it kept cycling until some point after the classic movie era  when they realized that ships  like the galaxy class ships  would be going on longer and longer missions  necessitating longer ranges of stardates so rather than resetting to 00000  it increased to 100000 we come into tng when it s reached about 410000 
7480,startrek,i liked the episode where kirk said  captain s log stardate  apocalypse 
7481,startrek,have nt seen it here yet  so  the general consensus is that tos stardates run on a different system from tng et al stardate 411537 does not mean  35 years since  stardate 592<SMILE> at some point  probably 2323  extrapolating back  they recalibrated the system for whatever reason  this is generally okay  although the new films throw a  third  system into the mix they seem to use a system that corresponds to the actual earth date   223304  meaning early 2233   the kelvin was using this system  so it was a prime system in use before tos  the reboot enterprise also uses it  which means that in that timeline they kept the earthcentric system in place  the issue arrives when nuspock enters the jellyfish and the computer gives him a stardate of 23<SMILE>7 the jellyfish was from the tng era of the prime timeline  so the stardate  should  have been something 64000 did the computer universallytranslate the time to something nuspock understood  or did starfleet go  back  to the earthcentric system sometime between nemesis and nero 
7482,startrek,i like the idea of a decimal day calendar stardate 0 equals day 1  and stardate 10000  equals day 10 thousand this makes each 1000 stardates equal to 27 yeras 
7483,startrek,not sure of the exact system  but my  omega canon   head canon  has always been that the first digit in tos stardates denotes the year of the mission 1xxxx stardates correspond to the first year  5xxxx to the last year  yes  i know it does nt work when you take tas stardates into consideration no  i do nt know how to resolve it  except to say that tas stardates are wrong and the tos stardates are right 
7484,startrek,you re not alone   makes it a nightmare when you re trying to write a backstory for an rp characteri usually default to either earth years or if you can relate it to another planet s years  that works too 
7485,startrek,gt  the implementation of the star date really bothers me  first world problems 
7486,startrek,they should be using  unix epoch     enmwikipediaorgwikiunix_time 
7487,startrek,k  i just finished ds9 it was amazing but you already know that  my question is about stuff happening simultaneously like  presumably gen takes place during ds9  right  because it s after tng ends so what s going on aboard ds9 while picard is trying to stop soaryn  i know that in fc  we see worf commanding the defiant  a nod to ds9 but when did i see worf get called away from the station to fight the borg at earth  like  the borg are scarcely mentioned in ds9 if the borg were literally attacking earth  there d be some mention of it on ds9 sisko would probably get called away to command a ship  probably the defiant tbh  stuff like this bugs me i try to dismiss this stuff and accept that these filmsshows are all made by different groups of people who do nt necessarily sit down and iron out continuity issues but it always kinda nags at me that there are so many times when things do nt quite jive  then there s the ferengi boy  they changed in ds9 it almost feels like ds9 is nt even star trek sometimes it s amazing  entertaining  wellacted  wellwritten and a generally great show but it does nt feel like it fits in alongside tos or tng but about the ferengi  in tng  they re portrayed as pirates  thieves  and so on the first contact with them was about stolen equipment and the ferengi in that episode had those cool electricity whips why did i never see those again  there were tons of ferengi in ds9 they were nt pirates or thieves  though they were traders and swindlers they never seemed to use weapons  except that psychopath that quark brought to save his mom from iggy pop   that s so different than the tng ferengi that would commandeer the enterprise a ds9 ferengi would trick you into legit selling him your ship for peanuts a tng ferengi would hijack your ship with force see the difference  again  i know there s a lot of creative reasons why these things happened different teams  different producers  different writers and directors i get it it s just weird how different ds9 feels than anything else  i ve just started voyager now i m 5 episodes in and i like it  but it definitely feels more like tng  and that s another thing  voyager disappears while pursuing maquis  presumably somewhere near ds9  why is there no mention of this in ds9  i know in the first ep of voyager  they depart from ds9 and quark is there but you d think there would be a ds9 episode where they mention something about voyager leaving to pursue maquis  all in all  i love each st entity i ve seen  even the films that everyone says are terrible but it does bug me to see stuff like this these things are taking place in the same universe  why ca nt they be a bit more tied together  unless they are and i just missed the explanations for this stuff  which is totally possible 
7488,startrek,generations takes place a couple years into ds9 it s before worf shows up  so there s no real question of how he got to the enterprise  and you did nt see worf get called away you did nt see every event of every day on ds9 it s something you just did nt see timing of lining up shared universe movies with tv shows like what marvel does did nt really happen back then it would have been unreasonable to expect that of ds9  as for the ferengi  yes  ds9 changed them a lot did they change them more than tng changed klingons i d argue no they changed the appearance of klingons they changed the general attitude of klingons in tos we do nt see the klingons with hand based weapons  but in all other shows it s made known that is how the klingons prefer to fight  yeah  there s some continuity stuff among aliens it happens across a lot of series it does nt really happen too badly in voyager  but they mostly created their own aliens also  i personally think ent was really great about that but ds9 and tng both made changes in aliens 
7489,startrek,a number of folks have tried to put together comprehensive timelines of all star trek from beginning to end here s a decent and wellthoughout one    <URL> it places generations around the time of the ds9 episode  distant voices   the one where bashir is attacked by the lethian and is wandering around inside his own mind   you can scroll down to where first contact fits  the uniform switch is a good indicator   you do not see worf being called away from ds9 with the defiant you can presume that it happened between episodes a story i ve heard is that the film crew and the ds9 crew did nt get along  which is why you do nt see much mention of the film in ds9  apart from  i think  one offhand reference in  in purgatory s shadow 
7490,startrek,i think a lot of the stuff with the ferengis was about the philosophy of the two shows tng was saying   look how much better we are than those assholes haha   but ds9 had a much more realistic vision of not only the federation  but how other cultures view us not all moral centers are the same  and if i remember correctly  there was a lot of back and forth between writers  directors  and actors about what quark should be  in a way that tng would nt have really cared to do 
7491,startrek,a lot of people have done the same thing and had the same reaction 
7492,startrek,favorite ep  prefer kes or seven 
7493,startrek,well wanting to stick to making fun adventurish star trek is a plus 
7494,startrek,the article was going so well until this bit  gt  jj abrams struck the right balance between guilty pleasure and warmly remembered traits  sigh   he really did nt 
7495,startrek,  <URL>
7496,startrek,this image was deeply unsettling to me 
7497,startrek,that is a fucking terrifying kirk spock and mccoy are off but still kinda passable as human  but holy crap  that kirk 
7498,startrek,the ensigns are getting younger and younger these days
7499,startrek,is that from the wax museum  that would explain how each character is just slightly off  it s weird that the wax museums more often than not got something slightly off from those wax figures you ca nt tell what  but it just feels wrong close  but wrong 
7500,startrek,shatner looks here more like lt barclaydwight schultz than kirk 
7501,startrek,this reminds me of the tas episode we all know transporters can deage
7502,startrek,damned transporter mishaps  now we got ta waste a whole episode fixing it 
7503,startrek,awesome i already watched them  but i might have a second go in the future already seen voyager twice 
7504,startrek,havent been able to get them on either in the uk for a long time now 
7505,startrek,canadian netflix only has tng ugh 
7506,startrek,oh  good i do nt have to rush out and buy ds9 
7507,startrek,thank god they already took doctor who from me 
7508,startrek,this is good  but i need dr who back 
7509,startrek,so when is netflix getting the firstthird movies and first contact 
7510,startrek,good i ve never watched it and they are on my queue
7511,startrek,great scene the part with mccoy and his father is one of the most impactful moments in the whole franchise really adds to his character  too bad the rest of the film sucked 
7512,startrek,weird part is that  given the synopsis  trek v actually had a lot of potential   an attempt at a peaceful multigovernmental world that basically became a bureaucratic backwater   armed terrorists taking over the enterprise  and the crew having to try to take it back deck by deck   a political triangle with the klingons  the romulans  and the federation   spock s long lost brother  on a fanatical religious mission  letting no one get in his way   having to crash land a shuttle into the shuttle bay while under threat of a bird of prey  all of these elements sound so cool on paper  but were executed so poorly in the movie 
7513,startrek,other than scotty who seems to have suddenly <URL> completely imbecilic to be honest trek v could have easily been so much better 
7514,startrek,yes that scene with mccoy and his father is one of the most poignant and powerful scenes in all of trek  and for characterization  i d say the way spock is portrayed in v is the most like his tos self than any of the other movies  much to dislike in this film  but i can still appreciate its quality moments 
7515,startrek,great score  too probably my favourite music of all the trek movies  although st 1 2 6 7 <SMILE> are also excellent 
7516,startrek,maybe this is because the movie is entirely about character development 
7517,startrek,yeah  this was a good scene v had its moments  both good and bad it s an entertaining movie  if not a particularly good one 
7518,startrek,i contend this scene is one of the best in all the movies to me this one scene redeems the rest of the movie 
7519,startrek,is everyone familiar with redlettermedia  they did a plinkett  commentary on this one and it s available on bandcamp    <URL>
7520,startrek,this film is actually one of my favourites because of the characterisation of everyone  not only did it make good use of the diverse chemistry between kirk  spock and mccoy  it also was the film that had some scenes where the rest of the crew interacted that made me realize for the first time that i did nt know enough about them and _their_ relationships towards each other and that i wanted to see more of it that movie changed the rest of the crew from  they are importand characters but not the main characters  to  they are people with lives and identities and friendships too  add that to the movie theme of life and death  family and friends  comfort and conflict  yes it had it s issues  but i ve never understood why it is getting so much dislike 
7521,startrek,whew  i ve been going back through tng and thinking about another rewatch of ds9 glad they re staying 
7522,startrek,was there really rumors about this  it was confirmed st was staying on netflix the day all this started 
7523,startrek,currently working my way through voyager for the first time thanks 
7524,startrek,imo sybok should nt have been spock s brother  but perhaps some kind of vulcan religious authority the dialogue that spock ca nt kill his brother could ve been replaced by the equally logical  explanation  i ca nt kill the vulcan equivalent of the pope or the dalai lama  for the rest i agree with about everything here  a messy movie that tries too hard to be funny  that uhura nude scene  argh    but perhaps because i can see the original intention of the movie it has a special place in my heart and as thus i rank it higher than the find the whale  thing 
7525,startrek,thank god  i have to finish voyager
7526,startrek,who fucking cares if whatever gets whatever hate when will we stop apologizing for personal preference 
7527,startrek,  despite rumors   due to public backlash
7528,startrek,i actually really liked this one i mean  it was no wrath or voyage  but it was a good little romp through space 
7529,startrek,i wish we had it on netflix over here i would be happy even if we just got one of the franchises 
7530,startrek,thanks for posting that link i must admit that beyond playing spock  i did nt know much of anything about nimoy s life shame on me for not learning more about him when he was still alive 
7531,startrek,that article made me sad all over again  for both men 
7532,startrek,so this is why he missed the funeral 
7533,startrek,now if only they would get first contact back  
7534,startrek,thats good i m in the middle of rewatching tng that being said  they could lose the animated series really who watches that 
7535,startrek,yay  while i ve watched them all enough to almost have them memorized  my wife is on her first viewing we re just about done with tng and we re in the second season of ds9 i can slow down the pace and we can enjoy them a little more now 
7536,startrek,angela bassett is an excellent actress  and she has the facial structure to be a great starfleet captain good voice  good presence i can imagine her staring down a klingon ambassador during a parley or enemy captain in the viewscreen  the only scifi movies she has done that i can recall are  supernova  and  strange days   strange days  is worth a watch  but it s now quite dated  what with all the  year 2000 is approaching and everything is going to hell  motif she was also great in  malcolm x 
7537,startrek,gina torres would be my pick 
7538,startrek,time to quit everything and <URL> an actor i sure as hell wo nt get into space  but being on an episode of star trek is the next best thing 
7539,startrek,this article is sourced from what was probably a throwaway comment fuller made back in 2013 i d say this is nt very likely  though not impossible 
7540,startrek,i have no problem with this but consider the source unless i m very much mistaken this is speculation from a blackinterest website  take it with a pinch of salt for now 
7541,startrek,we could do a lot worse it feels like a political choice but she s a fine actress 
7542,startrek,mmm so long as it s not another attempt at  strong female captain  and is  well written  interesting characters  i ll be onboard with whomever they pick
7543,startrek,i like angela bassett myself  and if the phasers and torpedoes failshe can always lay some voodoo on the enemy 
7544,startrek,  <URL>
7545,startrek,to be honest  i could nt put a face to the name when i read that title however that first picture on the article made me think she actually does  look  like a starship captain 
7546,startrek,the best parts of season two are all of the hints regarding the dominion it s hilarious that quark essentially learns about them first 
7547,startrek,i ve never thought about it  and it s just a really nice way to start a sceneepisode  i love startrek  but ppl getting too caught up in minor details can be such a drag sometimes  and prob robs future writers of scope  knowing that any small discrepancy will be torn apart 
7548,startrek,watching tng from the beginning  only halfway through s2  but i am sort of annoyed with worf this time through  worf never lived among klingons  yet speaks of all their customs  culture  cuisine as if he had first hand intimate knowledge of them  further  he takes great pride in something that he has no part of whenever talking about their fighting  weapons  all of the above  he s very proud  a sentiment that does nt make sense from the perspective he has of his race  just my thoughts on it 
7549,startrek,1  worf was 6 when his biological parents died before then he was raised by klingons you learn and pick up a lot in 6 years you do nt think that his family talked to him about honor and taught him how to fight by the time he was 6  2  while on earth growing up  worf was made aware that he was different he would get into fights  he accidentally killed a kid during a soccer game his klingonness was a source of differentness i think it would be normal for him to fantasize about his original culture to fantasize about a place he fit in part of that would involve learning as much about it as he could  3  his adoptive parents wanted him to embrace his klingonness as much as possible while fitting in in the federation they would have encouraged him to learn about his culture  replicated his foods  helped him with customs  i think the question is  who made you the gatekeeper who decides who the real klingons are 
7550,startrek,i think this is quite common for people who are from a country but spend most of their lives outside of it they have some idea of what the culture is  based on what they last knew of it  and cling on  no pun intended  to that identity 
7551,startrek,a couple of things  worf lived with klingons until he was six  but more importantly  when he was 15 he moved to qonos and lived with cousins it was there her performed his rite of ascension and really had full immersion on klingon culture  i like to think that because it was so romanticized  he really appreciated klingon culture deep within his core 
7552,startrek,more to the point  i think it s an interesting statement about race other klingons did nt take  being klingon  as seriously as worf did  something i think jadzia this mentions to him   i think it s because of his hybrid identity experience that he makes such a big deal out of performing klingonness  it speaks to a big insecurity in worf s identity that s always how i read it 
7553,startrek,i agree with op it is hands down the best star trek game 
7554,startrek,i ve never understood the hate for this movie it s a true send off for the series  it wraps up the kirk story quite well i thought opens on the tng crew on a ship at sea  the enterprise d crashes  data says  shit   malcolm mcdowell  kirk and picard riding horses  what am i missing here 
7555,startrek,it s my second favourite tng film  after first contact of course  mind you i ca nt stand the other two tng films 
7556,startrek,i thought it was a solid film felt very in the spirit of tng where as first contact  not so much  the scene in the end with picard and riker standing on the destroyed bridge gets me everytime i love that bridge 
7557,startrek,i think it was better than first contact and the best of the tng films at least from a writing standpoint the other tng films were halfassed or used up old themes 
7558,startrek,ignore the plasma coil  just remodulate the shields 
7559,startrek,i like the film too the best of the tng movies in my opinion 
7560,startrek,excellent filmone of the best movies of the decadethe nexus 
7561,startrek,the only thing that really got to me about generations was the damn inconsistencies in the uniforms  are we switching to ds9 uniforms or sticking with tng  they never did fully decide and i m aware that picard and data were the only ones who had custom tailored uniforms due to budgetary constraints  but damn it  if you ca nt afford to change everyone s uniforms then stick with the old ones  rant over 
7562,startrek,i do nt have a problem with the movie besides the throwaway deaths of kirk and picard s family  but it is far from my favorite of the movies 
7563,startrek,there s plenty to love about it  but the way kirk died is so pissweak considering everything he survived previously he did nt have an opportunity to go out like a badass like he always should have  or to return through the nexus to a massive fanfare  or just remain in his personal heaven 
7564,startrek,the ribbon of joy  kirk dead  yeah  i did nt care for this one 
7565,startrek,what do you think of the red letter media review 
7566,startrek,objectively speaking  there are a lot of thematic and plot problems none of those things matter if you love it 
7567,startrek,i have very fond memories of watching generations at the movies my only failing with it  and with some of the other movies  is that it did nt feel like an epic movie it just felt like a long episode with better spfx and because it was a movie they felt like they had to destroy the enterprise  because that s what you do in movies   first contact felt epic i liked insurrection  but again it felt like a two part episode more than a movie   and nemesis i liked butfor some reason there s no rewatchability  god i could have sworn that was a real word 
7568,startrek,i just zapped through all my current podcasts again so i m hoping to give this a swing  thanks for the <URL> 
7569,startrek,forgive my lack of actual military knowledge  that is why i am asking the group this question  so wesley crusher is given a field commission to the rank of an ensign he is subsequently seen wearing an official uniform and pips on his collar is this common  and what happens to this rank when he later goes to starfleet academy as a cadet  it seems a bit unfair to those fellow cadets who start in wesley s cadet class who may have never served on a starship  when wesley has been serving for years as an acting ensign and now an actual ensign also does wesley have to attend the entry level classes explaining the very basics of star fleet  so many questions 
7570,startrek,the idea of someone getting a field commission is probably not unheard of  though it s likely more common in situations like voyager  or after a major battle in the dominion war also probably not with 1415 year olds  when he went to the academy the rank went away it would have looked good on his resume and probably fast tracked him for promotion if he d graduated the academy  as opposed to running off with the traveler  but it would have meant very little at the academy directly  as to fairness to other cadets  it s probably no different than someone who d done high school internships in their field of study going to college today you ve got a bit more knowledge  but as long as you do nt treat your fellow students like you re better than them  which i ca nt really see wesley doing  they likely would nt consider it a bad thing  and he probably would have been a popular studybuddy  and he probably would have been able to get out of the truly introductory level classes  but i doubt it was automatic  he d likely have to take a challenge exam to do so 
7571,startrek,field promotions are usually done for filling in officer positions for a unit that lots several officers  entd does nt need another ensign  and remember  wesley s rank is actually  according to picard   acting ensign   acting whatever basically is  you get the title and job  but not the salary and other benefits   picard later did promote wesley to a full ensign  making the appointment permanent  however  keep in mind that as uvwboyaf1 said  cadet ranks are separate from actual ranks you can be a noobfreshmanmaggot in basic  academy and still be an officer  enlisted in active service separate chains of command and all that  and it s assumed that people who got the sfa are pretty bright already and do nt need the basic intro there may be a little hazing for indoctrination  but probably nowhere as hard as modern human academies 
7572,startrek,such harsh words for a woman who has given so much to bajor fret not  _my child_ the prophets will forgive you 
7573,startrek,the difference between kai winn and keiko is that winn is annoyingevil on purpose and as part of her character keiko is just annoying 
7574,startrek,she channeled her nurse ratched well 
7575,startrek,kai winn was star trek s king joffrey 
7576,startrek,can someone explain the whole keiko thing to me  i mean  what is really wrong with her character  what her character do to deserve it 
7577,startrek,no wonder kai winn is a sociopath 
7578,startrek,typical condescending arrogance of the deluded religious fanatic not <URL> in the real world at all 
7579,startrek,one of my favorite experiences at the military academy i attended was when i was just a newb  and one my fellow newbies had prior enlisted experience on active duty  he was a marine corporal  but at school  he was just a newb like us  one day  the upper classmen were in a particularly foul mood  and laying it on my buddy a little too thick my buddy understandably got pissed  disappeared into his dorm room  and reappeared in his marine uniform he then proceeded to announce his intention to  end  some of the upper classmen if they did nt  calm their tits  after that  he put his cadet uniform back on  and acted as though nothing had happened  i hope this answers your question 
7580,startrek,this is star trek do nt confuse what you see happening with star fleet and a real military just go with the flow and enjoy the stories 
7581,startrek,there s a reason she s an oscar winner amazing actress i love her arguments with kira  especially that time she puts kira in her place and you can see kira went too far 
7582,startrek,kai wynn was superb at being someone you love to hate 
7583,startrek,wait  what s wrong with keiko  i love keiko 
7584,startrek,gt  but we  re guessing a lot of these announcements are done algorithmically so  the writer does nt even know the full story  rip journalism 
7585,startrek, any time soon   so as soon as the current contracts expire 
7586,startrek,i wouldnt even mind if they did leave streaming services as long as they rereleased voyager and ds9 on dvd or bluray i wouldnt mind owning all of star trek if it was actually available for a reasonable price 
7587,startrek,i ca nt read the word stardate without accidentally thinking of a giant metal ring  a kawoosh and a puddle 
7588,startrek,star date was meant to be arbitrary and keep people from trying to tie things to real dates in tng and later  they stuck to making sure that later episodes used higher stardates but beyond that there wasnt a lot of thought put into them there is some content i think its in an interview but idr  that suggest that the stardate is a time scale that accounts for the time dialation inherant in using sublight engines i do know that the last digit represents a day  i think a standardized 26 hour day  and that anything affer a decimal is a direct decimal part of the day 
7589,startrek,i ll give you another reasonbto dislike star dates  they are some what arbitrary at least on tos  on tng they started with 4  for the 24th century and 1 for the first season of the show  going up 1 every follow season  generally  tge rest of the numbers are arbitrary as far as i can tell there is no way of matching the star date with the calendar date 
7590,startrek,please no  she draws far too much attention to herself  both because of her name and her acting style it s too dramatic the new captain should not be a big name either 
7591,startrek,i was always thinking about a nonhuman as the captain of a starship but  you know  wishful thinking 
7592,startrek,i was hoping for mark rylance  but angela bassett is also a strong choice prefer ophelia lovibond to rosario 
7593,startrek,i m also watching ds9 as a firsttimer and i m a few episodes into season 3 loving it for the most part 
7594,startrek,you like odo and quark  good the other characters get close to being as cool as them  but they are the best 
7595,startrek,real estate is an illiquid asset 
7596,startrek,given quark s oftstated jealousy over his cousin s ownership of a moon  i d say nog just does nt get the value of land 
7597,startrek,my favorite quote  gt  this is not the first time that  star trek  appeared on tv  as a  star trek  series titled  star trek  enterprise  was aired in upn network 
7598,startrek,gt  the first  star trek  tv series  led by jj abrams  was somewhat a success remind me which one it was 
7599,startrek,it s a sign that it was written by a teen and that you re getting old  i had a similar sign in 19<SMILE>0 when i was sitting in a restaurant with a gaggle of teen girls in the booth behind me  overheard   did you    know    that paul mccartney was in a band  before  he was in wings    breathlessly    really      wow    that s when i first realized that i was getting old  the same way you should be feeling now when you read that  this was not the first time that  star trek  appeared on tv  as a  star trek  series titled  star trek  enterprise  was aired in upn network  the best part is that the next thirtysix years will be gone before you know it 
7600,startrek,i do nt think i ve seen a more broken universal translator 
7601,startrek,i loved this game so much when i was a kid all the little details like having to swipe upwards on the three control strips to activate the transporter  the huge database of star trek info  the self destruct  being able to overload things in engineering and have the ship explode it was just awesome  i was so disappointed in star trek generations as a pseudosequel  i d love to go back to afu again  but i ve got no idea how i d get it to run on a modern pc running windows 7 i had enough trouble getting it to run on a windows 95 machine 
7602,startrek,i find disturbing the lack of accurate information on that  article   a 5 minutes visit to wikipedia must be so hard of an effort before writting 
7603,startrek,was this written in english  translated to japanese then back into english   
7604,startrek,this whole article reads like it was written in chinese by a five year old then translated by google into english 
7605,startrek,here s what a good version would have looked like    <URL>
7606,startrek,i ve always thought v could ve been much  much better there s some great ideas it just is nt put together very well
7607,startrek,do you want to promote piracy cbs  because this is how you promote piracy 
7608,startrek,so i decided to watch ds9 after reading some posts about it on here and with my brother s encouragement we are going through it together and i must say i quite like it i m halfway into season 2 and am a fan of odo and quark i am aware that the show gets better with the facial hair phenomena akin to riker s beard when sisko shaves and grows out the goatee looking forward to see how it all plays out 
7609,startrek,well  that s good because i m currently rewatching tng and do nt want to be stopped in the middle 
7610,startrek,in netflix canada it directly told me on the startrek tng panel that the title was leaving netflix march 10 
7611,startrek,she looks captainly 
7612,startrek,good  i still need to finish voyager and start enterprise 
7613,startrek,i freaked out when i saw they were leaving  my girlfriend and i started watching tng a few years back and are just now approaching the end of the series  have about 15 eps left   seeing as i take so long to watch series   i m not one to marathon a show   i thought i was going to cry glad all is ok 
7614,startrek,depends for me  if it means she will no longer be on american horror story then no thank you 
7615,startrek,while overall it was not a great trek movie   5 did have some great moments i especially liked sulu and checkov lost in the woods scotty walking his head on the bulkhead  and the jailbreak it could have been better  but it was nt as bad as everyone makes out
7616,startrek,yay  i really want to show trek to my daughter someday  so i hope it remains available to stream 
7617,startrek,currently weighing my curiosity against my opinion of the daily mail 
7618,startrek,i still think that if st  v is viewed as an extended original series episode  it is much more enjoyable as opposed to comparing it to the other movies 
7619,startrek,those guys looks off 
7620,startrek,my vote  jared harris from expanse  mad men  and sherlock holmes   <URL>
7621,startrek,i d hope they d write the main character and then cast a good actor not the other way around 
7622,startrek,amanda tapping that is all 
7623,startrek,last one is my favorite too  
7624,startrek,yeah all are good  but the unnecessarily bright and inexplicable lens flare was a nice capper 
7625,startrek,star trek valentines are the best valentines 
7626,startrek,the fricking digital versions of manifest destiny better have those covers included or i m going to be annoyed 
7627,startrek,it s not like it will be the first female starfleet captain to be portrayed  so i do nt get why this such a big deal what i m curious is if she is a good actor  since i have nt seem any of her movies 
7628,startrek,she looks captainy i see it 
7629,startrek,my favorite is the one with the shuttlebay  man  the shuttlebay does nt look big enough it needs to be like  twice as big  at least   but then it would nt fit on the ship   then make the ship bigger  it s not like star trek fans are gon na look too deeply into this sort of thing 
7630,startrek,so  i do a star trek podcast with a friend called  17 to 01   we talk history  effects  behind the scenes  etc while we watch the episodes on netflix  in august  we ll be out of tos on netflix and we ll start the films the films are nt on  or are nt reliably on  netflix so we ll have to buy a collection for each of us and watch along to those  i have one  but it s cheaper to buy two new ones than a second of the one i currently have   we d like a common cut of the movies so the odds are good that someone watching along at home is in sync with us as a bonus  i d like to have a version with informative commentary and behind the scenes stuff  i ve never said this to a human before  but i m interested in hearing about your star trek dvds if you ve got the original series films on dvd  what version do you have and how are the features on it 
7631,startrek,i d <URL> this versions of the dvds    <URL>  sr_1_1  ie  utf<SMILE>amp  qid  145555<SMILE>700amp  sr  <SMILE>1amp  keywords  startrekthewrathofkhandvddirector  27scut that s for wrath of khan and there are similar ones for the other films  wrath of khan is the only one  i think  with a director s cut  but it s actually only a few minor changes some different angles in one scene and a couple extended scenes but they are changes that i personally like  plus this dvd set  and the ones like it for the other films  have the michael and denise okuda text commentaries  which are missing from the blurays and well worth watching i also have nt found picture quality to be any better on the blurays versus these dvds 
7632,startrek,there s only one bluray cut for each of the films they ve been repackaged numerous times in box sets and will be again for the 50th anniversary  so buy whichever one you want 
7633,startrek,from 2013 from fuller   i want angela bassett to be the captain  that  s who i would love to have  you know captain angela bassett and first officer rosario dawson i would love to do that version of the show but that  s in the future to be told  he s probably had the characters he wants to inhabit his corner of the trek universe sketched out for quite some time 
7634,startrek,that was the very first game i ever bought on cdrom it really was impressive i d love to see a rerelease  but cbs does nt seem to know what to do with star trek games at all 
7635,startrek,i read uss saratoga and got all excited that we know the new the ship name then i realized i have to learn to read entire sentences 
7636,startrek,hey everyone  i m completely foreign to the star trek i was wondering what series i should start with the old movies   ivi  the next generation   19942002  the reboot series   2009present  or what tv series 
7637,startrek,star trek is a tv franchise with film spinoffs your best option would be starting with tos or tng    <URL> i started watching trek last october with tos  and i d <URL> starting from there if you can get past the 60s feel and slowpaced storytelling  it s the show that started it all then you can continue on with the films and shows in  the correct order  you see in the guide above  if it s too dated for you  start with tng the first two seasons are rough  but season 3 and on is great every trek series after tos takes about two seasons to find its footing  so give them a chance before giving up  here s a more detailed guide i d <URL> also giving a read basically expands on what i just said    <URL>
7638,startrek,  <URL> but do nt start with movies in general the heart of star trek is tv start with them 
7639,startrek,i have to agree with the others  the heart and soul of star trek is the various tv series  the movies are just a bonus the movies are mostly action focused and tend to revolve around evil villains who are up to no good and must be stopped  which is a poor reflection of what the franchise has to offer as a whole  the original series from the 60s is the true starting point  but it can be difficult for a modern viewer to get into the next generation is the gentlest entry point as it s not quite as dated  but be aware that its first two seasons are a bit sucky deep space nine is my personal favourite  and is generally well regarded by fans  but it s best watched after having seen tng voyager and enterprise have some good qualities  but probably are nt the best place to start 
7640,startrek,all these other comments are good  but to answer your question i highly <URL> wrath of khan it s widely considered the best star trek film  and it s easy to get into since it was written as a movie for general audiences  thus you do nt really need to watch space seed before watching the movie   it was my first introduction to trek and it worked for me 
7641,startrek,if you must do movies  i d do out of order  star trek iv  the voyage home first  just to get them interested  you know it s a pretty standard adventure and you do nt really need all the backstory  yet   once you got them interested  do a marathon st2st3st4 i personally is extremely  meh  on st5 
7642,startrek,probably star trek  the next generation  tos might be a bit hard to watch as it shows its age in places  that s not saying people should nt watch it   i do nt think you d get a complete idea of what star trek is supposed to be about from the other series 
7643,startrek,you are a new fan because you saw what  i started with star trek 2009  then went to season 1 episode 1 tng but as a general rule  star trek is a tv series  the movies are more like an appendage  p i still <URL> having a go at st 2009 before going into the series tho  because is fun  but what you will get in the series is so much better 
7644,startrek,i d start with next gen  personally as i kid i got into the original series by watching the movies  then went back and watched the show 
7645,startrek,it depends on whether you like scifi or action if you re an action movie fan and do nt care about writing  then the new stuff 
7646,startrek,enterprise is a great place to start it s a nice introduction to the universe of star trek then go to tng  then ds9 then voyager 
7647,startrek,gt  the esteemed actress might be the franchise  s second black woman to play a starfleet captain  not at all they counted madge sinclair as captain of the  saratoga  in st4  but there have two or three more since first you have laforge s mother  captain of the  hera   captain tryla scott of the  renegade  in the tng episode  conspiracy  and the actress who voiced the dead captain in  the sound of her voice  was black  though obviously that does nt guarantee that the character was black  in fact we have no idea   there s also been at least one black woman admiral in tng  you can argue  correctly  that black women are underrepresented in trek compared to their proportion of the global human population  logically  we should nt expect starfleet to be overwhelmingly represented by americans  but for obvious reasons they turned out to be anyway   but at least get your facts straight  p
7648,startrek,i think she would make a great captain as horribly written janeway was  i still did enjoy her on voyager
7649,startrek,tng is what my dad started me on as a kid i d <URL> starting the even though i grew up on it  i ll openly admit that it can get kinda cheesy here and there 
7650,startrek,i do think it could do with a remaster and rerelease but i wish that they would keep the 2d art style  except maybe for the flight sim portions of the tactical console   just enhance the cutscenes for the most part and clean it up to run at higher resolutions but  let s face it  i d be happy if they d release it as a dosbox wrapper so that i could play it without having to track down my cd 
7651,startrek,a male asian captain makes the most sense severely underrepresented in star trek unless earths history shows some huge genocide happened in asia 
7652,startrek,hi guys  i love sci fi but for some reason i never got into star trek i want to change that but i do nt know where to start should i watch everything star trek from the first tv series or can i start with something more recent  thanks guys

7654,startrek,i was a bit apprehensive  so i started with the reboot  2009  movies to get a basic intro to the universe those movies were made with the intent to bring in new audiences  so they re clear without being overly informational yes  they have their flaws  but i do nt think i would ve gotten into tos without having watched them first 
7655,startrek,i d say start at the beginning  but that s because that s where i would for a new fan  starting with the next generation is nt bad the first season will be closer to the original series in writing style 
7656,startrek,  <URL> the  cardassian war room     <URL>  was a set from the episode ds9 s03e09 defiant i just watched this episode today and thought it s a shame that they did nt use this set again in later seasons for the dominion instead  the female founder  weyoun  damar and the breen were often squeezed into this tiny room with a monitor 
7657,startrek,cardassians like big and showy the founder likely wanted a more secure facility 
7658,startrek,i seem to recall reading somewhere that the viewscreen wall was a miniature  and was never really there in that set 
7659,startrek,maybe because it was a special effect room the background wall with the viewsreen is actually a miniature inserted by green screen every green screen shot costs money for the sfx  but it was a problem with the last season  a lot of important decisions were made in small rooms  like sisko was in fact president of the ufp and ds9 its headquarters   the sets didnt match the scale of the story 
7660,startrek,i kind of like the relatively small space of the dominion s cardassian hq  since it gave a real feel of hitlerinthebunker in the latter stages of the war 
7661,startrek,they were seriously the power couple of all the series  though ds9 was really the only one that went into relationships worth exploring 
7662,startrek,dabo 
7663,startrek,i like how she just signs her name  and he s like  no one knows who i am  better put the character s name too 
7664,startrek,i m not sure how popular she is among fans or on this subreddit  so i m a bit afraid to ask this question but did anybody else find her character intolerable  i m not really sure how she has a following i guess she  the actor  was good at playing an intolerable person  so that s something 
7665,startrek,windows ng 
7666,startrek,definitely not the xp background photograph was taken in 1996    enwikipediaorgwikibliss_  image 
7667,startrek,a wallpaper from an os that came out in 2001 mysteriously appears in an episode of star trek that broadcast in 19<SMILE>  great  another star trek time travel paradox first willie mays  and now this  thanks roddenberry 
7668,startrek,no it s just green grass and a blue sky 
7669,startrek,would be odd  considering the 13 year gap between them but hey  maybe it was some stock imagine that somebody dug up 
7670,startrek,i do nt get the one about carol marcus  uniform can anyone explain 
7671,startrek, much lt  3   much profit  a true ferengi response 
7672,startrek,weird how that was a more convincing romance than keiko and miles
7673,startrek,i go through a tng kick every few months i usually skip the tasha episodes  but i was bored enough of everything else that it finally seemed worth it to rewatch the earlier seasons during her final farewell  tasha stands in front of what looks like an xp wallpaper the clouds do nt look quite right  so i m not sure if it s just similar either way i think it s hilarious    <URL>   <URL> edit  forgot that xp came out way later my bad so similar  but not the same  unless the xp image was an old stock image or something 
7674,startrek,do nt skip any ds9 it is heavily serialized  and while season 1 is nt as integral as others  the universe building and background is very important you ll regret skipping any as you ll miss critical character development there are subplots included in some s1  bad episodes  that are crucial to understanding some of the most complex characters in all of star trek   move along home  is definitely the worst ds9 episode 
7675,startrek,i do nt hate the film  but i will single out one issue i always had with it  killing off all of picard s blood relatives we know of simply to give him a temptation to stay in the nexus  sure  it was ron moore who created those characters to help picard in family  but their deaths fit a pattern established in the tos years of killing off most people kirk was close to who did nt wear a starfleet uniform  his edith keeler  his brother and his sisterinlaw  kirok s wife  and then his son  the movie after they meet because according to the writers  he had to be punished for using protomatter in genesis  cheating at playing god   carrying the trope over to tng like this annoyed me the more i thought about it  and if sisko s wife being killed in ds9 s pilot had nt been written to make good use of picard s crossover  i might be annoyed about that too 
7676,startrek,it was really <URL> not seeing any trek in my watch list for a while like it needs to be there for my own comfort if not a big part of me is missing 
7677,startrek,it is  and still remains  the best tng movie  not even sure why people love first contact so much and then say generations plot is horrible  what annoys me the most is if the borg can travel back in time at will why not do it every episode or movie they are in  that s not even the biggest annoyance with the film  picard goes from being a respected  intelligent  peaceful diplomat to an <SMILE>0s action movie protagonist hell bent on revenge without any regard for the safety of the ship or his crew you could argue that the borg violated him in the most intimate and personal way and his emotions overrode his rationality  i would agree if it were shortly after they recovered him in the series but i ca nt really remember which episode but later on in the series he realises that committing genocide would make him no better than the borg and he did this against the wishes of starfleet  he made peace with what happened to him and now all of a sudden he goes all rambo  so yeah fuck first contact generations is the best tng movie 
7678,startrek,before  there was a message saying that the shows would be going away in x number of days with just a few days until the countdown expired  they appear to have reached an agreement with cbs  
7679,startrek,would be nice if it was on uk prime
7680,startrek,let s hope netflix keep them as well and finally make them available in other countries 
7681,startrek,as i ve said here and elsewhere  all that panic at the disco was unnecessary it was simply amazon s license was up for renewal but everyone went off halfcocked  speculating that cbs was pulling everything from streaming and moving it to all access  relax  folks  everyone grab a green drink and chill 
7682,startrek,but i just finished yesterday   
7683,startrek,but  will  be leaving once cbs launches its for pay streaming service 
7684,startrek,i ca nt deal with this uncertainty i just want something to stay on a service so i can watch it i have both prime and netflix and i go to watch an episode of battlestar galactica that struck my fancy and it s gone  wtf 
7685,startrek,gt  what am i missing here  taste 
7686,startrek,is there any video of this in action 
7687,startrek,star trek v may have been a horrible fucking movie  but looking at its fundamentals  it was nt bad trek the way the jjverse movies have been  i mean  yes  as actually executed it was a massive fucking misfire but if you sift through all of the its problems it was  fundamentally  a decent trek story 
7688,startrek,this is why generations is horrible    <URL>
7689,startrek,hope so it makes no sense skipping a free source of money like that 
7690,startrek,if only i could get them here overseas with subs somewhere hulunetflixamazon none of them have that shit 
7691,startrek,can we just start calling drones what they really are  toys they re rc toys 
7692,startrek,so the quad is in the saucer section  i assumed the stardrive section has the electronics and battery that means the entire thing is horribly unbalanced  and probably terrible to fly 
7693,startrek,see  i was interested  but then i saw it was not the enterprisee 
7694,startrek,mmmmm and it s a connie refit never more happy that i clicked a link 
7695,startrek,i love that it opens with them on a ship at sea  because gene roddenberry gave patrick stewart the  horatio hornblower  books as a way of understanding what kind of man picard was supposed to be horatio hornblower is basically picard on a ship at sea instead of a ship in space  and so we get to see picard on a ship at sea 
7696,startrek,the music for generations ranks among the best scores i ve ever heard 
7697,startrek,and the way she delivers lines is all around bad 
7698,startrek,i totally agree all the more credit to the writing and the acting  louise fletcher was great  kai winn and gul dukat were awesome villians
7699,startrek,walk with the prophets my child  i know you will
7700,startrek,     even at the most difficult moments of his life  his fame intruded  the divorce judge actually brought a photo of spock into the courtroom and asked for an autograph   wow  how can someone be so ridiculously insensitive  all sadness aside  that was a very interesting article thanks for the link  op 
7701,startrek,this was always in the back of my head as a kid reminds me of the people who go out of their way to be proud of the country they are from maybe he felt alienated by the humans his age and latched on to the klingon persona also i thought he went to a klingon school for a bit as a teenager 
7702,startrek,i have a bunch of them  listed from most controversial to least  roughly      ds9 is not the  best trek     while it s a good show that deserves a lot of the praise it gets  ds9 is unbalanced it goes too far into the dark and gritty tng s main problem is that it sometimes went too far into the politically correct tos is the most balanced trek  and that s why i think it s the best depiction of  trek values   frankly  i m tired of the ds9 veneration and the trashing of tos around here     tos is not  dated     if you bother to actually watch  the issues that the episodes address are just as relevant today as they were in 1966 whining about special effects when star trek was never about glitzy effects in the first place is missing the forest for the trees i can understand if tos is  just not your thing   but if you re truly that bothered by special effects that are nt perfect  i m sorry  you re a baby     picard s behavior in first contact is not out of character    depicting him as so singlemindedly determined to defend his ship and defeat the borg is perfectly consistent with a man who has excess baggage from being captured and forced to wage war against his own people     spock is not literally a descendant of sherlock holmes    a lot of trekkies seem to take that quote literally  but i ve always interpreted it to mean that as a man of logic  spock is something of a successordescendant to holmes  not that you can literally trace spock s family tree back to holmes 
7703,startrek,while we re troll baiting  how about this  i can navigate a television show without anyone having to hold my hand i do nt need to ask where to start  or which episodes to skip  or if i should see the movies  or what i was supposed to think about an episode i m a big boy i can do those things without asking anyone 
7704,startrek,i d add  there are too many acronyms 
7705,startrek,1  pulaski was a _far_ more interesting and dynamic character than crusher i would even say that she was played by a better actress as well crusher was mostly window dressing for all intents and purposes and the episodes that did feature her as a central character tended to be pretty weak  2  star trek  the motion picture was a great trek film it has its issues but i would rather watch it five times in a row than watch _any_ of the tng films  3  voyager killed star trek s prime universe voyager was a show that lasted five more seasons than it deserved and to be honest  if it had been cancelled early  enterprise would have  assuming it even got made  been more successful because it would mean that berman would have rightly been pulled from his position in favor of someone who was not creatively burned out voyager was a bad show and while trek fans may be tolerant  the general tv audience clearly was not and rightfully so  4  seven of nine was not that interesting jeri ryan was a good actress and she did surprisingly well with the garbage she was handed but as a whole  she was really just put in the show to up the t and a factor as a boost for ratings they did not even try to hide that fact  when i look back on the show  seven  like most of the other characters  only had a few episodes where she was really able to do something interesting the rest of the time she was just repeating the same old borg lines over and over  5  ds9 s first two seasons were fantastic from the pilot on  the show did a great job setting up the world  the situation  and the characters those who found it too  slow    religious   or worse yet   boring  missed the point  6  skipping episodes if you have never seen them based on some internet list is stupid make your own choices  7  if the new trek show is based in the jjverse  that does not automatically make it bad there are good stories you can tell in that setting  <SMILE>  we get it  enterprise had a bad theme song  get over it you would think that people would just skip it and move on with their lives without posting how much they hate it over and over again heck  i hate it to but i do nt feel the need to announce it  9  the novels tend to be nothing much more than glorified fanfiction these days and i am glad they are not canon as a result  10  star trek casting decisions and series ideas are best handled by seasoned industry professionals i know your post borgwar show with the enterprise f being crewed by the entire firefly cast seems like a great idea but it really is not 
7706,startrek,i think the abrams movies were entertaining  i caught a glimpse of the tngstyle mandarin collars on the uniforms in the stb trailer and hope i m right that was always more a sign of a good episode to me than riker s beard  i acknowledge the importance and significance of tos  but i do nt ever really intend to watch the series  i do nt mind faith of the heart i think it accurately embodies the heart of what enterprise and the exploratory side of trek was always about  i think the reason that spock and data were so popular is because many fans never knew how to deal with their own emotions 
7707,startrek, voyager is better than tng in almost every way far better characters  better stories  is a lot funnier  and it has more of the original series  spirit and sense of fun than tng ever did   the wrath of khan uniforms are absolutely awful i ca nt stand them i wish they had kept the beautiful 70s futurist uniforms from the motion picture  and yes  i know part of the reason they changed them was that the actors basically had to completely take off the costume to use the bathroom  
7708,startrek, hmm   could have sworn most of those  are  the popular opinions to have here nowadays 
7709,startrek,the motion picture is the best movie in the franchise  and i like the original opening music to enterprise in fact it was what i liked best about the show 
7710,startrek,klingons are fucking dull  outside of the final reflection 
7711,startrek,i do nt like troi  i find her annoying and selfrighteous  as riker put it once  aristocratic 
7712,startrek,ds9  while possessing some great characters  is rather flawed they do nt understand religion or morals at all the writers are pretty much anti science
7713,startrek, enterprise is my favorite series before rewatching it recently i did nt care for it  and had nt watched it since it aired  but now i love it   before enterprise was my favorite  voyager was   while i like picard and data  i do nt really care much for tng i do nt think it s aged very well and that could be a big reason i plan on doing a full watch through after i finish enterprise again  but i doubt my opinion will change   while into darkness has flaws  for the most part i find it enjoyable 
7714,startrek,the first two seasons of all the trek spinoffs are by and large shit  out of all of them though  enterprise has the highest number of decent episodes  i implore you to go through the episode guides on memory alpha and count up the episodes you would happily sit down and watch if you came across them on tv for me  enterprise had almost twice as many episodes as tng 
7715,startrek,i liked nemesis except for the wedding part and a few other corny things and hated the original star trek movies  i loved the original series but the original movie was so slow and boring taking that long to get to the enterprise i liked most of the other original movies though just not the motion picture
7716,startrek,jerry goldsmith s tmp theme was wholly inappropriate for the movie and was recycled way too often it should never have been used for any tng movie  and neither should goldsmith s  klingon  motif any time worf was onscreen  
7717,startrek,there s far too much time travel in   star   trek typically it involves earth and the mechanics are inconsistent 
7718,startrek,i like dr pulaski more than dr crusher a lot more  i think the 4th tos movie  the voyage home  is the  worst  trek movie ever made even counting the jj movies  tuvok is my favorite vulcan  janeway is my favorite captain because she s batshit crazy  riker was a douchebag most of the time  star trek  legacy was a fantastic game 
7719,startrek,character development in ds9 gets way way too much credit odo went from fascinating outsider to boring  ca nt we all be friends  wimp worf is often an even more goofy character than he was in tng obrien is just a moping drunk  seemingly bashir and sisko just get more and more sedate as the show goes on  going from wry to callous without getting more interesting  i love the show  love the characters but people act like ds9 did things with character never done before honestly  i prefer the arcs of data  spock  the doctor  even archer and tpol to most of the arcs in ds9 we see those characters grow as people and officers and not just  get grittier  nothing but love for quark and garak though sometimes popular opinions are dead on 
7720,startrek,character development in ds9 gets way way too much credit odo went from fascinating outsider to boring  ca nt we all be friends  wimp worf is often an even more goofy character than he was in tng obrien is just a moping drunk  seemingly bashir and sisko just get more and more sedate as the show goes on  going from wry to callous without getting more interesting  i love the show  love the characters but people act like ds9 did things with character never done before honestly  i prefer the arcs of data  spock  the doctor  even archer and tpol to most of the arcs in ds9 we see those characters grow as people and officers and not just  get grittier  nothing but love for quark and garak though sometimes popular opinions are dead on 
7721,startrek,without explanations as to why you feel this way  it s just trolling 
7722,startrek,gt  she makes keiko seem pleasant  woah  woah  woah ok man  lookwe all hate winn  but that was uncalledfor 
7723,startrek, i like into darkness   pine is a better kirkactor than shatner   i ve tried watching tos and could nt get into it   i think stid is more interesting than wok  i m greatly looking forward to beyond
7724,startrek,picard benefits enormously from plot armour  and deserved to failhave the enterprise destroyedbe killed on many occasions  disregarding the sound advice from his securitytactical officer and following his idealism he is also very rarely ever presented with a genuine rockhard place scenario which would dent his moral high ground  dr pulaski was a better  more interesting character than dr crusher because she presented a different point of view  and challenged characters like data and worf  giving them development  the klingons are overused and their empire makes no sense at all  they all seem to be from small family groups  know one another  yet control a vast empire spanning lightyears their culture also seems to have almost no education  academic classes  engineers or scientists  and yet they can compete with the federation  romulans  and dominion technologically  tng ruined the borg long before voyager did  with i  borg and descent the borg were really only good in q who and best of both world s  and any of their voyager appearances trump their later tng appearances easily 
7725,startrek, it s a disgrace how little respectattention tos gets around here i say this as a 21 year old who just got into the franchise  while i agree that tng is great for the most part  i think it s somewhat overrated around here even in the best seasons  there are 510 episodes per season that range from  meh  to bad  and many episodes are derailed by boring  meaningless technobabble solutions   09 trek is fantastic and into darkness is pretty good both movies got me into trek in the first place  and i m confident that beyond will be pretty good as well  the undiscovered country is only okay and the final frontier is better than it gets credit for  i do nt agree at all that the motion picture is most similar to tos  as is so often spouted it relied on excessive visual sequences far more than either tos or any of the tos movies 
7726,startrek,growing up on tng and ds9 i did nt think i d be able to get into tos at all i was wrong i loved it 
7727,startrek,mine is that i actually really love voyager i m not going to argue against how there are many terrible early episodes and how the kazon were honestly just a weak villain group and a nuisance  but once seven shows up  i really began to love it stuff was actually at stake  they had a real overarching plot like ds9  not just a couple connected episodes like tng w romulan and borg  arcs   and while janeway annoyed me in the beginning   especially with her damn bun  i really did love her in the end yes  they made the borg look weak sometimes  yes  they always had a predictable shuttle crash episode each season  but for some reason  i really grew to like it i liked the idea of having a ship that is truly going where no man has gone before  wo starfleet to back them up each time lt  insert crazy butthurt alien heregt  came knocking and seeing more of the borg w seven of nine was really cool  and the doctor was a really interesting character after he got the mobile emitter  even though he was somewhat a copy of data s character at the end of the day  i really like it  but i wo nt argue that voyager is certainly an acquired taste  and while tng will always have a place of course  voyager really can take the cake sometimes for me after all  janeway found coffee nebulae 
7728,startrek, i liked uniforms and wrist communicators from the motion picture    darmok  is an average episode at best   belanna is more attractive than seven 
7729,startrek,voyager is my favorite series  star trek iv  the voyage home is my favorite movie 
7730,startrek, i ve tried watching tos and could nt get into it   i did nt think  year of hell  or  equinox  were all that great 
7731,startrek,i like dr pulaski she feels more like a genuine  trained medical professional and more of an allaround human being than crusher  i know she was basically a bones clone  but i think her character worked really well and added some necessary human conflict and emotion back in the early part of tng when roddenberry s  humans in the future have no conflict  was still law 
7732,startrek,the final frontier is severely underrated 
7733,startrek,i do nt like first contact it works if you shut your brain off  but trek up until that point was nt about shutting your brain off in order to enjoy it there s too many plot holes and things that just do nt make sense 
7734,startrek,she has her moments 
7735,startrek,hmmm i m not that familiar with her work  but angela basset certainly has that authoritative look that a star trek captain needs got ta have the voice for it  too  though   no idea what she sounds like 
7736,startrek,i m just loving the idea the more i m thinking about it  she has the poise  the voice and the class she s well rounded and perfect for the role please make this happen    <URL>  v  gscq_mn0evc
7737,startrek,personally  i think it would be fascinating to see a nonhuman captain i think it would provide an amazing perspective and be in line with what trek has always tried to do 
7738,startrek,so i decided to watch ds9 after reading some posts about it on here and with my brother s encouragement we are going through it together and i must say i quite like it i m halfway into season 2 and am a fan of odo and quark i am aware that the show gets better with the facial hair phenomena akin to riker s beard when sisko shaves and grows out the goatee looking forward to see how it all plays out 
7739,startrek,it gets better before the hair thing imo the finale for season 2 pretty much sets up the rest of the show 
7740,startrek,the best parts of season two are all of the hints regarding the dominion it s hilarious that quark essentially learns about them first 
7741,startrek,yeah by season 4 it gets really good  enjoy the watch through
7742,startrek,skip  move along home  if it s not too late 
7743,startrek,i m also watching ds9 as a firsttimer and i m a few episodes into season 3 loving it for the most part 
7744,startrek,you like odo and quark  good the other characters get close to being as cool as them  but they are the best 
7745,startrek,ai nt no party like a ds9 party
7746,startrek,also known as the  starfleet technical manual  by franz joseph published 1975  isbn 0345340744
7747,startrek,would nt spock have found it a bit  insulting  to have been referred to as the  most human soul  kirk had encountered  i love the scene  but that quote always seemed slightly off to me  thoughts 
7748,startrek,spock was half human and had worked for some time on understanding  feeling and showing his human emotions it was a heartfelt compliment and would have been taken so i m sure 
7749,startrek, spock lived up to the ideals of humanity better than any human i have met  it s a pretty deep compliment 
7750,startrek,also  what is a soul
7751,startrek,xpost referenced from rtlhinganhol by ushanoxilt  how to be a klingon male     <URL>         i   am   a   bot   made   for   your   convenience     especially   for   mobile   users      contact     <URL>  to  originalpostsearcher        code     <URL>        faq     <URL>  faq 
7752,startrek,use your ridges to make orange juice lol
7753,startrek,well that s a good sign so far maybe it wo nt be doomed to cbs all access 
7754,startrek,its still not available in the uk tho  
7755,startrek,i kinda want cbs to offer all access through amazon it would certainly cut down on how many subscriptions i would need the problem would be streaming some of their live stuff  like big brother 
7756,startrek,as i ve said here and elsewhere  all that panic at the disco was unnecessary it was simply amazon s license was up for renewal but everyone went off halfcocked  speculating that cbs was pulling everything from streaming and moving it to all access  relax  folks  everyone grab a green drink and chill 
7757,startrek,phew  watching tng for the first time  it s awesome  and was afraid i was going to get cut off 
7758,startrek,i m almost done with ds9 i hope i can get through voy and ent before it goes away for good 
7759,startrek,this is going to be interesting to watch it may be more of a stay of execution  one that just kicks the can down the road i personally think cbs making all access  the  place for trek is still a very real possibility  if not an eventuality  to be sure  fans clamoring for a  free lunch   or simply the network model in streaming form  for pennies on the dollar   are going to be quite upset when content creators wo nt stand for that that day is likely coming and this goes way beyond the 2017 trek series  just wait until disney does something crazy  like buying netflix for their own personal streaming platform then watch the chaos unfold 
7760,startrek,i ve never understood the hate for this movie it s a true send off for the series  it wraps up the kirk story quite well i thought opens on the tng crew on a ship at sea  the enterprise d crashes  data says  shit   malcolm mcdowell  kirk and picard riding horses  what am i missing here 
7761,startrek,objectively speaking  there are a lot of thematic and plot problems none of those things matter if you love it 
7762,startrek,i do nt hate the film  but i will single out one issue i always had with it  killing off all of picard s blood relatives we know of simply to give him a temptation to stay in the nexus  sure  it was ron moore who created those characters to help picard in family  but their deaths fit a pattern established in the tos years of killing off most people kirk was close to who did nt wear a starfleet uniform  his edith keeler  his brother and his sisterinlaw  kirok s wife  and then his son  the movie after they meet because according to the writers  he had to be punished for using protomatter in genesis  cheating at playing god   carrying the trope over to tng like this annoyed me the more i thought about it  and if sisko s wife being killed in ds9 s pilot had nt been written to make good use of picard s crossover  i might be annoyed about that too 
7763,startrek,the music for generations ranks among the best scores i ve ever heard 
7764,startrek,i love that it opens with them on a ship at sea  because gene roddenberry gave patrick stewart the  horatio hornblower  books as a way of understanding what kind of man picard was supposed to be horatio hornblower is basically picard on a ship at sea instead of a ship in space  and so we get to see picard on a ship at sea 
7765,startrek,it s my second favourite tng film  after first contact of course  mind you i ca nt stand the other two tng films 
7766,startrek,it is  and still remains  the best tng movie  not even sure why people love first contact so much and then say generations plot is horrible  what annoys me the most is if the borg can travel back in time at will why not do it every episode or movie they are in  that s not even the biggest annoyance with the film  picard goes from being a respected  intelligent  peaceful diplomat to an <SMILE>0s action movie protagonist hell bent on revenge without any regard for the safety of the ship or his crew you could argue that the borg violated him in the most intimate and personal way and his emotions overrode his rationality  i would agree if it were shortly after they recovered him in the series but i ca nt really remember which episode but later on in the series he realises that committing genocide would make him no better than the borg and he did this against the wishes of starfleet  he made peace with what happened to him and now all of a sudden he goes all rambo  so yeah fuck first contact generations is the best tng movie 
7767,startrek,i thought it was a solid film felt very in the spirit of tng where as first contact  not so much  the scene in the end with picard and riker standing on the destroyed bridge gets me everytime i love that bridge 
7768,startrek,i think it was better than first contact and the best of the tng films at least from a writing standpoint the other tng films were halfassed or used up old themes 
7769,startrek,ignore the plasma coil  just remodulate the shields 
7770,startrek,i like the film too the best of the tng movies in my opinion 
7771,startrek,excellent filmone of the best movies of the decadethe nexus 
7772,startrek,the only thing that really got to me about generations was the damn inconsistencies in the uniforms  are we switching to ds9 uniforms or sticking with tng  they never did fully decide and i m aware that picard and data were the only ones who had custom tailored uniforms due to budgetary constraints  but damn it  if you ca nt afford to change everyone s uniforms then stick with the old ones  rant over 
7773,startrek,this is why generations is horrible    <URL>
7774,startrek,i have very fond memories of watching generations at the movies my only failing with it  and with some of the other movies  is that it did nt feel like an epic movie it just felt like a long episode with better spfx and because it was a movie they felt like they had to destroy the enterprise  because that s what you do in movies   first contact felt epic i liked insurrection  but again it felt like a two part episode more than a movie   and nemesis i liked butfor some reason there s no rewatchability  god i could have sworn that was a real word 
7775,startrek,just rewatched it this weekend it s clumsily plotted and skimps on budget in the weirdest places  but it nails the tng characters picard hugging ren  in the nexus chokes me up every single time  as does data finding spot  i never had a problem with the way they killed kirk  but it did seem like they were just ticking boxes on a checklist so they could get to the next movie with a new  enterprise  and leaving the original cast behind in hindsight  a batonpassing movie seems pretty unnecessary 
7776,startrek,i do nt have a problem with the movie besides the throwaway deaths of kirk and picard s family  but it is far from my favorite of the movies 
7777,startrek,there s plenty to love about it  but the way kirk died is so pissweak considering everything he survived previously he did nt have an opportunity to go out like a badass like he always should have  or to return through the nexus to a massive fanfare  or just remain in his personal heaven 
7778,startrek,the ribbon of joy  kirk dead  yeah  i did nt care for this one 
7779,startrek,what do you think of the red letter media review 
7780,startrek,gt  what am i missing here  taste 
7781,startrek,i think the problem is there is so much of those scenes missing though 
7782,startrek,some more    <URL>  v  ijs0hhozfq   <URL>  v  ozwmoi5tyqs   <URL>  v  lwa0ixa7q
7783,startrek,so i tagged my friend on the video to show my friend  the author added me on facebook and is now posting strange messages to my wall and via pm   <URL>
7784,startrek,the guy also has a  blog     <URL>  with a number of renders of voyager and other ships if you go searching through  linked is my favourite post
7785,startrek,looks like hd transfer to me  instead of rerendering but then  the fb video is lowres enough to not be able to tell the difference 
7786,startrek,are those cardassian ships made out of legos  and could we please get more ships in one shot  because you know  space is not that big 
7787,startrek,yes but spock was in a box kirk could say whatever made him and the others feel good about the loss of their friend 
7788,startrek,am i the only one who remembers this  i ca nt seem to find a video of it anywhere so i m beginning to wonder if my brain invented it 
7789,startrek,held off watching voyager for a while was pleasantly surprised 
7790,startrek,poor max grod  nchik he s actually uglier without makeup
7791,startrek,so even wesley crusher can fly it 
7792,startrek,although i agree with the answers you ve received  trek is really about the tv shows  and tng is probably the best place to start  just be warned that the first 2 seasons of tng are nt exactly great tv   i think it s worth actually answering the question in the title of your post  if you really want to start with the movies  watch the original series movies  ivi   i and v are not universally liked  but the rest are good  and will give you a reasonable idea of what star trek is about  sadly  the tng movies are not very good  the reboot movies are good action movies but do nt really represent star trek 
7793,startrek,the movies are based on characters and stories that were built up from the tv series i would actually <URL> trying the next generation tv series  and go through the guides others have posted do nt be afraid to skip bad episodes in the first couple seasons i wrote a personalized opinion  here     <URL>  context  3  a few weeks ago about which episodes were most important to watch in the first couple seasons i stand behind my assessment  if you really want to go with a film  just watch the first of the 2009 series do nt watch into darkness until much later  because it kind of ruins things that happened in one of the actual best films in the franchise if you enjoy the 2009 film  go back to the original series  watch the episode space seed  and any of the other good ones  there are lists all over the web of the best of tos   then start with star trek 2  the wrath of khan  and just finish that series off 5 is skippable  it s a pretty bad film altogether the motion picture is also skippable  it s not a great film either and it s really dense unless you re deep into the trek universe it s worth watching at some point  but it really is  bad 2001  a space odyssey 
7794,startrek,i do nt know if this is an unpopular opinion  but i never really see it i hate voyage home  i thought it was the stupidest thing ever with a damn whale probe thing  and basically having the nccretirement home01a doddling around san fran was just cheap for laughs  easy on budget  and an excuse to do some time travel undiscovered country was much better but this is my ranty asshole side showing for just a bit 
7795,startrek, i ca nt bring myself to watch tos again  many  many reasons   i love the farout stories of tng seasons 1  2  insurrection is my favourite film  i love the tech  ships and continuity of trek above all else   enterprise is massively underrrated  i do not believe a single writer to date has had the balls to depict the truly utopian future in which trek is set  ya know while its all on the table also  no hate to tos it started it all i struggle to watch it because despite the argument  it really is dated and all i see is budget limitations everywhere 
7796,startrek,i like spock s brain sometimes halfway through a really complex task i pause and get confused and think  what am i thinking  no one can transplant a brain 
7797,startrek,while i adore the enterpriserefit design and respect matt jefferies original designs  the upgrade of the enterprise in the reboot was needed as i got older and became more observant  i started to not like the design on the original and the refit     the slender neck    it s so thin that is seem like nothing practical can go there thus a waste of space it also seems like a huge tactical disadvantage since one torpedo could punch a whole through it or  as  wok  showed  a phaser blast can severely damage it the torsion on that section of the ship much be enormous     the bridge on top of the ship    both  ent  and  nemesis  showed that a bridge on top of the ship is a bad idea granted  the reboot has the bridge up top  but it does have some sort of deck space above it that sort of cushions it  though the windowviewer creates a new but smaller weak spot   i just want a design where the bridge is not exposed  like have it just one deck below the dome or make a  command deck  that houses the bridge  conference rooms  a other rooms and just have it either 1 deck below the dome or the bottom deck of the dome     the slenderness of the pylons    unless the are super armored  the pylons are a huge tactical disadvantage they are so slim  it seems like all you need is one good hit and you ll take out power to the nacelle and damage the ship from leaking plasma also  just like the neck  the forces exerted on them from the nacelles themselves must be atrocious while the reboot had bigger and bulkier nacelles  the pylons are a tad bit beefier     the overall size of the constitution class    when i was little  i thought the connie was bigger than it really was i can across the truth and the ship can off as very weak now i understand there wo nt be any supersized ships in the 23rd century when the federation is only about 100 years old however  it could have used a protein shake or two now that i m a little bit older  i understand that the use or repetitive corridors and long walking scenes are what gave me the impression that the ship was bigger still  it could have used either and upscale or a beef up think of the rebooted ship more around the size of the  ambassador  class  the only designs that i think are pretty practical that still have necks for the iconic star trek look are the  excelsior  class and the  ambassador  class  why not the  galaxy  class if you like the  ambassador   my issues with the  galaxy  class are for another day   but like i said before  i salute the  tos  design and adore the refit they just needed beefing up in my opinion 
7798,startrek,i hope not i m not finished with voyager
7799,startrek,right  because sulu and chekov  helmsman and navigator  getting lost in the forest or scotty banging his head on a pipe after boasting he knows the ship like the back of his hand  all just because shatner felt the need to humiliate all lead characters outside the big three  are signs of great characterization 
7800,startrek,just rewatched it this weekend it s clumsily plotted and skimps on budget in the weirdest places  but it nails the tng characters picard hugging ren  in the nexus chokes me up every single time  as does data finding spot  i never had a problem with the way they killed kirk  but it did seem like they were just ticking boxes on a checklist so they could get to the next movie with a new  enterprise  and leaving the original cast behind in hindsight  a batonpassing movie seems pretty unnecessary 
7801,startrek,gt  correction feb 16  2016 <URL> is a parody website    which was nt immediately clear to us    really 
7802,startrek,the  actual source   satirical       <URL> 
7803,startrek,i actually really like voyager and enterprise 
7804,startrek,she should have been _motherfucking_ storm halle berry is so underwhelming 
7805,startrek,i do nt care what race or gender the next captain is so long as they are great actors and well written characters  show us what you ve got  fuller 
7806,startrek,i m not too familiar with her  but from what i can tell it seems like she could be a good choice really though i just want a wellwritten character please do nt write her as a  black female captain   just write her as a captain  we do nt need all the stupid hashtag stuff and the inevitable articles that make it a big deal that she s  black and a woman   i wonder how much of it will come from people who do nt even watch trek  i mean  the whole point is that in star trek  we re past racial issues and discrimination no one cares anymore they re just  there   and it s not even a topic because it s not relevant i hope we can all look at it the same way too it would be great if she was cast and everyone just went   oh cool  she was good in  x  show  
7807,startrek,of all the shows on tv throughout the years that you could  possibly  accuse of being biased and bigoted  star trek is probably the least  they ve already had an interacial kiss  a lesbian kiss  a black captain  a female captain  a bald captain  a bald captain with a hairpiece  a nongendered love interest  and about 100 different colors of skin makeup  angela bassett being black and female would be par for the course in that regard the fact that she s a fantastic actor would be the real news 
7808,startrek,can we please stop   nostupidhashtags
7809,startrek,well  that was a little trip down memory lane i used to have this 
7810,startrek,captains chair was better you could virtually tour the bridge of og  d and e enterprise  voyager and defiant  you could fire a torpedo  set a security lockout or even set self destruct  it was a horrible low res quicktime vr but i loved it 
7811,startrek,i wonder where the original 35mm footage of that tour ended up  would ve been cool to get that in hd on the blurays 
7812,startrek,very cool 
7813,startrek,i keep on saying this but this show is really good so far i really love how this show takes an idea and just takes it everywhere it can go it really appeals to me and i am really enjoying watching the next thing that they explore i feel like i have a lot to say this time around so let s get to it   redemption  part ii not really as good as part 1 but some solid battles and data got time to shine pretty cool   darmok very good it finally helped me understand the universal translator and it was a really solid view at language and culture exchange that kept an interesting core to avoid being dull   ensign ro i know the bajorans <URL> important later and this was quite a good intro i had a hard time following the actual plot but ro was nice and it was saved by her character   silicon avatar the plot took a long journey before discovering what it was but what it was  was pretty damn good the story of revenge and the federation neglecting someone like that was very interesting and the ending was bold   disaster great character episode some cool and unusual pairings and great dialogue plot was ok too  i guess   the game while i did nt particularly desire to see wesley again this episode was nice and creepy but i ca nt say it s a new favourite of mine  either   unification very nice i liked seeing spock and the plot kept itself engaging throughout got slightly weaker when sela showed up but overall it was very well done and picard had a lot of great moments   a matter of honor i mean perspective i mean time certainly watchable but him being a conman was a bit obvious i liked some interactions between rasmussen and the crew but overall it was rather dull the actual problemsolving and picard s dilemma was really solid though   new ground not being a member of the fandom i do nt know what people think of alexander i think i quite like him the actor is really bad  but i like the way he acts as a foil for worf and he certainly brings something new to the show now the episode itself was pretty standard and only really got good during the ending   hero worship this was a fun episode  if a bit low on substance the child actor was  again  not that great but the episode was just a nice bit of fluff and there was some nice data scenes in there   violations well this episode was weird little actual plot and it was about rape overall i was nt that engaged but i did nt hate it either   the masterpiece society terribly dull it was way too much like a tos episode and troi romances seem to be doomed to be boring and unbelievably dumb but i did like the morality discussions quite a bit and that part was quite nice   conundrum really solid i liked the concept and the characters are explored from a whole new angle ro and riker have surprisingly good chemistry and the mystery aspect was well executed   power play the actors probably had a field day with this one and the possesed people did a bangup job of playing hose roles as for the actual plot i found the enterprise caper a lot more engaging than the old ship stuff and the ending did nt give me much but i ca nt say i dislike it   ethics great drama  if a bit soapy worf was very much in character but the real interesting stuff was between crusher and ellen degeneres  android clone ellenbot 3000 really did show the varied nature of people within the federation and she provided a different viewpoint in a believable way i mean you know they wo nt kill off worf but it was pretty nice to see him walking at the end   the outcast really good even if it does play it pretty safe in some areas the concept is interesting and wellexplored and the ending is wonderfully horrible  reminiscent of the city on the edge of forever i really liked soren s character and her and riker had a very genuine chemistry  maybe jonathan frakes just has chemistry with everyone   cause and effect loved it the looping was really well directed and executed and the plot got the concept across  while still moving forward and the characters got a chance to figure out a mystery   the first duty we are not allowed to forget wesley apparently but again  solid episode and putting a former main character in this morally wrong position and having picard absolutely fuming was a very bold choice and it gives some interesting insight into starfleet everyday   cost of living uhhhhhhh i did not need an alexandermama troi episode in my life i did nt get the holodeck scenes  alexander is kind of a twat and i was just not engaged surprisingly my favourite thing about it was lwaxana s relationship with her husbandtobe and the stuff around that   the perfect mate i feel really bad the episode is almost too good at presenting the metamorph character and the ending made me feel like shit the scenes with kamala and picard were fantastic  but i ca nt say i cared much for her scenes of seducing various men but as a concept episode it was pretty great what  there were ferengi in this episode  huh   imaginary friend more fucking children please stop doing this forever tng i was constantly groaning during this episode it mixes horrible child acting  the cassandra truth clich   a particular pet peeve of mine   and a moral issue that really did not need to be explored why did they make this   i borg absolutely fantastic it develops the borg in a great way and the various characters  response to everything was great prejudice  individuality and lot of interesting points are explored and hugh was great to see develop geordi got a chance to shine and the ending was kind of sad  but still ambiguous enough to be slightly hopeful   the next phase really liked it  the mystery was cool and the concept was well explored and the funeral planning and data stuff was just sweet as hell and i m really starting to love ro   the inner light  aka the one were picard <URL> jorel  well that out of the way this one is popular and i mean i liked it it was great as an exploration of life and picard got some really good stuff i wanted to see the episode develop and the ending was absolutely great i can see why people have a fondness for it   time s arrow  part i love it data is wonderful as a french inventor and i am really excited to see where it goes i did nt care much for the alien stuff but people s reaction to the data death stuff was very nice looking forward to part 2   now keep in mind this is a long list and i might misremember some episodes  or give them a weird rating it s also like 330 am as i write this i also might have been a bit to favourable this time aorund but what the hell until next time 
7814,startrek,holy shit  you got through season five fast 
7815,startrek,now  i m wondering what the original ears looked like 
7816,startrek,darn  there s a typo in the title should be  origin  not  original  
7817,startrek,just talking with an individual that is a newbie to the star trek fandom and got asked this question i was unable to provide any answer that gave them any meaning at all 
7818,startrek,well  they re a warrior race and aesthetically lady klingons probably dug dude klingons with the toughest looking forehead also perhaps many years before  like klingon cavemen times  they literally attacked each other with their foreheads 
7819,startrek,they attract mates and strike fear into potential rivals 
7820,startrek,there are different crests  for different bloodlines 
7821,startrek,they are sort of evolutionarily evolved from their equivalent of simians who butt heads to fight for dominance like terran rams the custom continues today when klingons go out and celebrate with drinking  they butt heads and laugh  much like terrans bump chests 
7822,startrek,family members all have similar crests  for one 
7823,startrek,i completely misread this post as  headrests   and i was trying to go through images of the chairs in the klingon ships to look at their headrests 
7824,startrek,imagine that the enterprise was a starship of the confederate space service  that the crew was ethnically homogeneous except for its executive officer  the first halfcaucasian  halfblack person in the fleet then the line reads     of all the souls i have encountered in my travels  his was the most  voice breaks  white    it s the truest and most heartfelt tribute captain kkkirk would know how to give 
7825,startrek,the source site is a chinese media company that has a number of local editions  at least according to its wikipedia page which appears to also have been written at about the same level 
7826,startrek,awesome i already watched them  but i might have a second go in the future already seen voyager twice 
7827,startrek,havent been able to get them on either in the uk for a long time now 
7828,startrek,in netflix canada it directly told me on the startrek tng panel that the title was leaving netflix march 10 
7829,startrek,canadian netflix only has tng ugh 
7830,startrek,  despite rumors   due to public backlash
7831,startrek,it was really <URL> not seeing any trek in my watch list for a while like it needs to be there for my own comfort if not a big part of me is missing 
7832,startrek, any time soon   so as soon as the current contracts expire 
7833,startrek,oh  good i do nt have to rush out and buy ds9 
7834,startrek,thank god  i have to finish voyager
7835,startrek,thank god they already took doctor who from me 
7836,startrek,well  that s good because i m currently rewatching tng and do nt want to be stopped in the middle 
7837,startrek,i wouldnt even mind if they did leave streaming services as long as they rereleased voyager and ds9 on dvd or bluray i wouldnt mind owning all of star trek if it was actually available for a reasonable price 
7838,startrek,i wish we had it on netflix over here i would be happy even if we just got one of the franchises 
7839,startrek,this is good  but i need dr who back 
7840,startrek,yay  while i ve watched them all enough to almost have them memorized  my wife is on her first viewing we re just about done with tng and we re in the second season of ds9 i can slow down the pace and we can enjoy them a little more now 
7841,startrek,so when is netflix getting the firstthird movies and first contact 
7842,startrek,but  will  be leaving once cbs launches its for pay streaming service 
7843,startrek,good i ve never watched it and they are on my queue
7844,startrek,i freaked out when i saw they were leaving  my girlfriend and i started watching tng a few years back and are just now approaching the end of the series  have about 15 eps left   seeing as i take so long to watch series   i m not one to marathon a show   i thought i was going to cry glad all is ok 
7845,startrek,was there really rumors about this  it was confirmed st was staying on netflix the day all this started 
7846,startrek,currently working my way through voyager for the first time thanks 
7847,startrek,i ca nt deal with this uncertainty i just want something to stay on a service so i can watch it i have both prime and netflix and i go to watch an episode of battlestar galactica that struck my fancy and it s gone  wtf 
7848,startrek,do you want to promote piracy cbs  because this is how you promote piracy 
7849,startrek,i hope not i m not finished with voyager
7850,startrek,yay  i really want to show trek to my daughter someday  so i hope it remains available to stream 
7851,startrek,whew  i ve been going back through tng and thinking about another rewatch of ds9 glad they re staying 
7852,startrek,gt  but we  re guessing a lot of these announcements are done algorithmically so  the writer does nt even know the full story  rip journalism 
7853,startrek,good  i still need to finish voyager and start enterprise 
7854,startrek,now if only they would get first contact back  
7855,startrek,thats good i m in the middle of rewatching tng that being said  they could lose the animated series really who watches that 
7856,startrek,i got a notice from audible this afternoon that the new book from uwilliamshatner about leonard has been released i know what i will be listening to in the car this week    <URL>   <URL>
7857,startrek,is it narrated by shatner 
7858,startrek,i kinda hope parts of the proceeds go to a charity  or else  in my unimportant opinion  its a kind of morally questionable thing to make money from 
7859,startrek,in  alliances   during the scene when all the kazon leaders enter the room for their big meeting  there are sound effects of somewhat silly ceremonial horns and an audience whistling and clapping as each one enters  i would be willing to say the horns are just part of the background music  or perhaps being provided by some kazon bugle boy off screen  but the clapping  there is nobody else in the room other than the voyager crew members the voyager members are seen during the moments we hear the clapping and they are clearly shown to not be the source of it  is the clapping supposed to be some prerecorded stock footage sound effect the kazon leaders play over hidden speakers whenever they enter a room together  just kind of seemed odd to me  made me feel like i was watching a <URL> for a minute 
7860,startrek,totally never noticed that before found the referenced scene on youtube    <URL>  v  6um2aot_vl<SMILE>
7861,startrek,it s interesting  people claim it only exists on the streaming version 
7862,startrek,i remember that scene i m pretty sure it was a prerecorded thing for making the kazon leaders look good it goes along with their propensity towards vanity and egocentric behavior 
7863,startrek,no one knows it only exists in the netflix version some have speculated that it s from an early cut of the episode that was never aired and that somehow netflix got a copy of this cut and not the final version 
7864,startrek,literally just finished watching the episode and chuckled about the silliness of the applause especially the moment when the audience goes crazy for culluh 
7865,startrek,i thought it had something to do to focus the audience s attention to the  supposed  popularity of the mahge being announced maybe  them trying to psychologically affect the captain 
7866,startrek,i have the dvd version  it s not in there 
7867,startrek,it really bad  and funny   but not as bad  and funny  as the rocks flying around whenever there is an explosion inside the ship 
7868,startrek,i happen to see the following video where levar burton said he was disappointed cause the new timeline would not have scope for the tng team    <URL>  v  ixckr3o6frc but if khan could have a different origin but was still destined to clash with kirk and team then why is there no scope for tng   edit  i mean the scope for tng in the current reboot series 
7869,startrek,in the nuuniverse  picard has thick curly hair and the crew wear capes and some special safety helmets 
7870,startrek,no reboots  please 
7871,startrek,idk  the ridiculousness of the mirror universe  all these characters were still born and still destined to interact with each other despite the incredibly different timelines   to me establishes a good enough precident for the cast of tng to come together in the nuuniverse 
7872,startrek,i would nt mind seeing tng rebooted after the tos reboot  it is entirely possible in my opinion 
7873,startrek,please no more reboots i want them to leave the existing material alone and come up with a new and original trek movie this trend of rebootingremaking movies has gone on long enough 
7874,startrek,forgive my lack of actual military knowledge  that is why i am asking the group this question  so wesley crusher is given a field commission to the rank of an ensign he is subsequently seen wearing an official uniform and pips on his collar is this common  and what happens to this rank when he later goes to starfleet academy as a cadet  it seems a bit unfair to those fellow cadets who start in wesley s cadet class who may have never served on a starship  when wesley has been serving for years as an acting ensign and now an actual ensign also does wesley have to attend the entry level classes explaining the very basics of star fleet  so many questions 
7875,startrek,one of my favorite experiences at the military academy i attended was when i was just a newb  and one my fellow newbies had prior enlisted experience on active duty  he was a marine corporal  but at school  he was just a newb like us  one day  the upper classmen were in a particularly foul mood  and laying it on my buddy a little too thick my buddy understandably got pissed  disappeared into his dorm room  and reappeared in his marine uniform he then proceeded to announce his intention to  end  some of the upper classmen if they did nt  calm their tits  after that  he put his cadet uniform back on  and acted as though nothing had happened  i hope this answers your question 
7876,startrek,this is star trek do nt confuse what you see happening with star fleet and a real military just go with the flow and enjoy the stories 
7877,startrek,the idea of someone getting a field commission is probably not unheard of  though it s likely more common in situations like voyager  or after a major battle in the dominion war also probably not with 1415 year olds  when he went to the academy the rank went away it would have looked good on his resume and probably fast tracked him for promotion if he d graduated the academy  as opposed to running off with the traveler  but it would have meant very little at the academy directly  as to fairness to other cadets  it s probably no different than someone who d done high school internships in their field of study going to college today you ve got a bit more knowledge  but as long as you do nt treat your fellow students like you re better than them  which i ca nt really see wesley doing  they likely would nt consider it a bad thing  and he probably would have been a popular studybuddy  and he probably would have been able to get out of the truly introductory level classes  but i doubt it was automatic  he d likely have to take a challenge exam to do so 
7878,startrek,field promotions are usually done for filling in officer positions for a unit that lots several officers  entd does nt need another ensign  and remember  wesley s rank is actually  according to picard   acting ensign   acting whatever basically is  you get the title and job  but not the salary and other benefits   picard later did promote wesley to a full ensign  making the appointment permanent  however  keep in mind that as uvwboyaf1 said  cadet ranks are separate from actual ranks you can be a noobfreshmanmaggot in basic  academy and still be an officer  enlisted in active service separate chains of command and all that  and it s assumed that people who got the sfa are pretty bright already and do nt need the basic intro there may be a little hazing for indoctrination  but probably nowhere as hard as modern human academies 
7879,startrek,he only needs a book  just take a look  reading rainbow 
7880,startrek,well done two thoughts though  1 why is keiko smiling  i do nt remember that episode  2 your riker makes me think of randy quaid 
7881,startrek,he can just call up lt uhnari or  holodeck and chill  with leah brahms 
7882,startrek,whowhat is it that q is with 
7883,startrek,remember that time when geordi made that sex hologram of that engineer  then later the real engineer found the sex hologram of her  hahaha
7884,startrek,levar burton talked about this on the nerdist podcast a while back basically the writers in his opinion did nt know how to write about a black man s sexuality in a nonstereotypical way everyone  including the android got to have sex at some point  but not geordi  worf does nt count because he s an alien and not michael dorn 
7885,startrek,your forgot my favorite tng romance  westley and robin from  the game  
7886,startrek,the older you get the less it hurts 
7887,startrek,his love was for that warp core and engineering was his makin sweet love to that ship you could count on laforge to be deep in the belly of the enterprise

7898,startrek,where s worf 
7899,startrek,i hope the new series rights this  they could do it in any number of ways set it on the same timeline and have a cameo with he and his family  maybe have his son be on the new ship  leaving it open for the character to pop in from time to time  i felt like star trek  while usually showing us how amazing and civilized the future would be  was saying except in love  where the engineering nerd will still fail to get any action  come on  throw us a bone  
7900,startrek,    
7901,startrek,you re gon na get sued 
7902,startrek,it just occurred to me that blind people can cry 
7903,startrek,who are the two in the picture before georgi s
7904,startrek,i totally agree all the more credit to the writing and the acting  louise fletcher was great  kai winn and gul dukat were awesome villians
7905,startrek,kai wynn was superb at being someone you love to hate 
7906,startrek,such harsh words for a woman who has given so much to bajor fret not  _my child_ the prophets will forgive you 
7907,startrek,the difference between kai winn and keiko is that winn is annoyingevil on purpose and as part of her character keiko is just annoying 
7908,startrek,there s a reason she s an oscar winner amazing actress i love her arguments with kira  especially that time she puts kira in her place and you can see kira went too far 
7909,startrek,kai winn truly displayed arrogance to its perfection even more so than q  at least he showed humility and kindness a few times 
7910,startrek,she channeled her nurse ratched well 
7911,startrek,gt  she makes keiko seem pleasant  woah  woah  woah ok man  lookwe all hate winn  but that was uncalledfor 
7912,startrek,she has her moments 
7913,startrek,walk with the prophets my child  i know you will
7914,startrek,kai winn was star trek s king joffrey 
7915,startrek,can someone explain the whole keiko thing to me  i mean  what is really wrong with her character  what her character do to deserve it 
7916,startrek,no wonder kai winn is a sociopath 
7917,startrek,wait  what s wrong with keiko  i love keiko 
7918,startrek,typical condescending arrogance of the deluded religious fanatic not <URL> in the real world at all 
7919,startrek,and the way she delivers lines is all around bad 
7920,startrek,just finished ds9 last night had nt watched it through since it first aired  anything ds9 related brings all the feels today  i love you rom 
7921,startrek,should ve had worf surrounded by his dead lovers 
7922,startrek,shoulda been laforge and his warp core 
7923,startrek,did nt  all good things  suggest he married leah brahms in the future 
7924,startrek,great scene the part with mccoy and his father is one of the most impactful moments in the whole franchise really adds to his character  too bad the rest of the film sucked 
7925,startrek,weird part is that  given the synopsis  trek v actually had a lot of potential   an attempt at a peaceful multigovernmental world that basically became a bureaucratic backwater   armed terrorists taking over the enterprise  and the crew having to try to take it back deck by deck   a political triangle with the klingons  the romulans  and the federation   spock s long lost brother  on a fanatical religious mission  letting no one get in his way   having to crash land a shuttle into the shuttle bay while under threat of a bird of prey  all of these elements sound so cool on paper  but were executed so poorly in the movie 
7926,startrek,other than scotty who seems to have suddenly <URL> completely imbecilic to be honest trek v could have easily been so much better 
7927,startrek,yes that scene with mccoy and his father is one of the most poignant and powerful scenes in all of trek  and for characterization  i d say the way spock is portrayed in v is the most like his tos self than any of the other movies  much to dislike in this film  but i can still appreciate its quality moments 
7928,startrek,this film is actually one of my favourites because of the characterisation of everyone  not only did it make good use of the diverse chemistry between kirk  spock and mccoy  it also was the film that had some scenes where the rest of the crew interacted that made me realize for the first time that i did nt know enough about them and _their_ relationships towards each other and that i wanted to see more of it that movie changed the rest of the crew from  they are importand characters but not the main characters  to  they are people with lives and identities and friendships too  add that to the movie theme of life and death  family and friends  comfort and conflict  yes it had it s issues  but i ve never understood why it is getting so much dislike 
7929,startrek,i still think that if st  v is viewed as an extended original series episode  it is much more enjoyable as opposed to comparing it to the other movies 
7930,startrek,great score  too probably my favourite music of all the trek movies  although st 1 2 6 7 <SMILE> are also excellent 
7931,startrek,while overall it was not a great trek movie   5 did have some great moments i especially liked sulu and checkov lost in the woods scotty walking his head on the bulkhead  and the jailbreak it could have been better  but it was nt as bad as everyone makes out
7932,startrek,maybe this is because the movie is entirely about character development 
7933,startrek,yeah  this was a good scene v had its moments  both good and bad it s an entertaining movie  if not a particularly good one 
7934,startrek,i actually really liked this one i mean  it was no wrath or voyage  but it was a good little romp through space 
7935,startrek,imo sybok should nt have been spock s brother  but perhaps some kind of vulcan religious authority the dialogue that spock ca nt kill his brother could ve been replaced by the equally logical  explanation  i ca nt kill the vulcan equivalent of the pope or the dalai lama  for the rest i agree with about everything here  a messy movie that tries too hard to be funny  that uhura nude scene  argh    but perhaps because i can see the original intention of the movie it has a special place in my heart and as thus i rank it higher than the find the whale  thing 
7936,startrek,i ve always thought v could ve been much  much better there s some great ideas it just is nt put together very well
7937,startrek,star trek v may have been a horrible fucking movie  but looking at its fundamentals  it was nt bad trek the way the jjverse movies have been  i mean  yes  as actually executed it was a massive fucking misfire but if you sift through all of the its problems it was  fundamentally  a decent trek story 
7938,startrek,i contend this scene is one of the best in all the movies to me this one scene redeems the rest of the movie 
7939,startrek,is everyone familiar with redlettermedia  they did a plinkett  commentary on this one and it s available on bandcamp    <URL>
7940,startrek,who fucking cares if whatever gets whatever hate when will we stop apologizing for personal preference 
7941,startrek,right  because sulu and chekov  helmsman and navigator  getting lost in the forest or scotty banging his head on a pipe after boasting he knows the ship like the back of his hand  all just because shatner felt the need to humiliate all lead characters outside the big three  are signs of great characterization 
7942,startrek,all it s missing is two space jellyfish 
7943,startrek,ya  rub those lobes 
7944,startrek,did nt a ferengi actor pass away recently  it s sad
7945,startrek,love the ds9 cast
7946,startrek,k  i just finished ds9 it was amazing but you already know that  my question is about stuff happening simultaneously like  presumably gen takes place during ds9  right  because it s after tng ends so what s going on aboard ds9 while picard is trying to stop soaryn  i know that in fc  we see worf commanding the defiant  a nod to ds9 but when did i see worf get called away from the station to fight the borg at earth  like  the borg are scarcely mentioned in ds9 if the borg were literally attacking earth  there d be some mention of it on ds9 sisko would probably get called away to command a ship  probably the defiant tbh  stuff like this bugs me i try to dismiss this stuff and accept that these filmsshows are all made by different groups of people who do nt necessarily sit down and iron out continuity issues but it always kinda nags at me that there are so many times when things do nt quite jive  then there s the ferengi boy  they changed in ds9 it almost feels like ds9 is nt even star trek sometimes it s amazing  entertaining  wellacted  wellwritten and a generally great show but it does nt feel like it fits in alongside tos or tng but about the ferengi  in tng  they re portrayed as pirates  thieves  and so on the first contact with them was about stolen equipment and the ferengi in that episode had those cool electricity whips why did i never see those again  there were tons of ferengi in ds9 they were nt pirates or thieves  though they were traders and swindlers they never seemed to use weapons  except that psychopath that quark brought to save his mom from iggy pop   that s so different than the tng ferengi that would commandeer the enterprise a ds9 ferengi would trick you into legit selling him your ship for peanuts a tng ferengi would hijack your ship with force see the difference  again  i know there s a lot of creative reasons why these things happened different teams  different producers  different writers and directors i get it it s just weird how different ds9 feels than anything else  i ve just started voyager now i m 5 episodes in and i like it  but it definitely feels more like tng  and that s another thing  voyager disappears while pursuing maquis  presumably somewhere near ds9  why is there no mention of this in ds9  i know in the first ep of voyager  they depart from ds9 and quark is there but you d think there would be a ds9 episode where they mention something about voyager leaving to pursue maquis  all in all  i love each st entity i ve seen  even the films that everyone says are terrible but it does bug me to see stuff like this these things are taking place in the same universe  why ca nt they be a bit more tied together  unless they are and i just missed the explanations for this stuff  which is totally possible 
7947,startrek,generations takes place a couple years into ds9 it s before worf shows up  so there s no real question of how he got to the enterprise  and you did nt see worf get called away you did nt see every event of every day on ds9 it s something you just did nt see timing of lining up shared universe movies with tv shows like what marvel does did nt really happen back then it would have been unreasonable to expect that of ds9  as for the ferengi  yes  ds9 changed them a lot did they change them more than tng changed klingons i d argue no they changed the appearance of klingons they changed the general attitude of klingons in tos we do nt see the klingons with hand based weapons  but in all other shows it s made known that is how the klingons prefer to fight  yeah  there s some continuity stuff among aliens it happens across a lot of series it does nt really happen too badly in voyager  but they mostly created their own aliens also  i personally think ent was really great about that but ds9 and tng both made changes in aliens 
7948,startrek,a number of folks have tried to put together comprehensive timelines of all star trek from beginning to end here s a decent and wellthoughout one    <URL> it places generations around the time of the ds9 episode  distant voices   the one where bashir is attacked by the lethian and is wandering around inside his own mind   you can scroll down to where first contact fits  the uniform switch is a good indicator   you do not see worf being called away from ds9 with the defiant you can presume that it happened between episodes a story i ve heard is that the film crew and the ds9 crew did nt get along  which is why you do nt see much mention of the film in ds9  apart from  i think  one offhand reference in  in purgatory s shadow 
7949,startrek,i think a lot of the stuff with the ferengis was about the philosophy of the two shows tng was saying   look how much better we are than those assholes haha   but ds9 had a much more realistic vision of not only the federation  but how other cultures view us not all moral centers are the same  and if i remember correctly  there was a lot of back and forth between writers  directors  and actors about what quark should be  in a way that tng would nt have really cared to do 
7950,startrek,i d say trek stargate is definitely nerdy  but it s also more militaristic and in some cases funny than trek ever was 
7951,startrek,why is this an argument both are pretty nerdy for own separate reasons  they are both awesome  i do nt think it matters 
7952,startrek,nobody say anything  they ll just use it in the next episode of big bang theory 
7953,startrek,what is your definition of nerdy  also do you mean the content is more nerdy or you mean it attracts more nerds 
7954,startrek,stargate  simply for the bit where oneil wants to call the ship they build the enterprise 
7955,startrek,if you re an archaeology geek  daniel jackson is the only pop culture archaeologist out there who is nt basically just a grave robber 
7956,startrek,arguing over which is nerdiest is the nerdiest thing of all 
7957,startrek,from what i can remember of stargate  trek had more techno babble in it stargate just had a big dude with a belt buckle on his forehead 
7958,startrek,held off watching voyager for a while was pleasantly surprised 
7959,startrek,a lot of people have done the same thing and had the same reaction 
7960,startrek,favorite ep  prefer kes or seven 
7961,startrek,it s fairly well known that bryan fuller likes to bring over actors from his previous shows    <URL> here s a cool run down of some of the actors who have appeared on multiple fuller shows  so there s a pretty good chance that some actors on that list or others who were on hannibal are going to show up on the new trek who would you like to see on the show 
7962,startrek,i do nt want eddie izzard on the show all the time  but i d like him on the show sometimes he could be the new harry mudd  or the new face of q  something like that 
7963,startrek,i have nt watched any of his shows  but i would love for jeffrey combs to be on the show in some capacity 
7964,startrek,the only answer is mads mikkelson as ship s counselor  d
7965,startrek,caroline dhavernas  because i love her
7966,startrek,jewel staite and gina torres  because firefly of course  jewel also because she had her time in space sf show once  space cases and i really hated how her character ended 
7967,startrek,gina torres would be an excellent captain or xo
7968,startrek,lee pace and chi mcbride were pretty great in pushing daisies chi mcbride would make a pretty good engineer lee did the villain thing in guardians he d make a great recurring bad guy 
7969,startrek,richard armitage would make a good klingon 
7970,startrek,send jewel staite back into space 
7971,startrek,raul muthafuckin  esparza  he was so great on  hannibal  and is pretty much the only reason svu is still watchable he s an extremely talented stage actor as well  he plays asshole characters very well  but can also be sympathetic when called for i could very easily see him excelling at a garaktype character  if the new show has one 
7972,startrek,hugh lancie  as a android it s pretty obvious choice he s already played an autistic person  so i can see him really working that angle well 
7973,startrek,i saw her at the gallifrey one con this weekend she won a game show during the masquerade and was all around brilliant 
7974,startrek,gt  the esteemed actress might be the franchise  s second black woman to play a starfleet captain  not at all they counted madge sinclair as captain of the  saratoga  in st4  but there have two or three more since first you have laforge s mother  captain of the  hera   captain tryla scott of the  renegade  in the tng episode  conspiracy  and the actress who voiced the dead captain in  the sound of her voice  was black  though obviously that does nt guarantee that the character was black  in fact we have no idea   there s also been at least one black woman admiral in tng  you can argue  correctly  that black women are underrepresented in trek compared to their proportion of the global human population  logically  we should nt expect starfleet to be overwhelmingly represented by americans  but for obvious reasons they turned out to be anyway   but at least get your facts straight  p
7975,startrek,a male asian captain makes the most sense severely underrepresented in star trek unless earths history shows some huge genocide happened in asia 
7976,startrek,to be honest  i could nt put a face to the name when i read that title however that first picture on the article made me think she actually does  look  like a starship captain 
7977,startrek,amanda tapping that is all 
7978,startrek,hmmm i m not that familiar with her work  but angela basset certainly has that authoritative look that a star trek captain needs got ta have the voice for it  too  though   no idea what she sounds like 
7979,startrek,i was always thinking about a nonhuman as the captain of a starship but  you know  wishful thinking 
7980,startrek,angela bassett is an excellent actress  and she has the facial structure to be a great starfleet captain good voice  good presence i can imagine her staring down a klingon ambassador during a parley or enemy captain in the viewscreen  the only scifi movies she has done that i can recall are  supernova  and  strange days   strange days  is worth a watch  but it s now quite dated  what with all the  year 2000 is approaching and everything is going to hell  motif she was also great in  malcolm x 
7981,startrek,  <URL>
7982,startrek,it s not like it will be the first female starfleet captain to be portrayed  so i do nt get why this such a big deal what i m curious is if she is a good actor  since i have nt seem any of her movies 
7983,startrek,gina torres would be my pick 
7984,startrek,i d hope they d write the main character and then cast a good actor not the other way around 
7985,startrek,i think she would make a great captain as horribly written janeway was  i still did enjoy her on voyager
7986,startrek,time to quit everything and <URL> an actor i sure as hell wo nt get into space  but being on an episode of star trek is the next best thing 
7987,startrek,she looks captainy i see it 
7988,startrek,this article is sourced from what was probably a throwaway comment fuller made back in 2013 i d say this is nt very likely  though not impossible 
7989,startrek,from 2013 from fuller   i want angela bassett to be the captain  that  s who i would love to have  you know captain angela bassett and first officer rosario dawson i would love to do that version of the show but that  s in the future to be told  he s probably had the characters he wants to inhabit his corner of the trek universe sketched out for quite some time 
7990,startrek,personally  i think it would be fascinating to see a nonhuman captain i think it would provide an amazing perspective and be in line with what trek has always tried to do 
7991,startrek,she looks captainly 
7992,startrek,please no  she draws far too much attention to herself  both because of her name and her acting style it s too dramatic the new captain should not be a big name either 
7993,startrek,i was hoping for mark rylance  but angela bassett is also a strong choice prefer ophelia lovibond to rosario 
7994,startrek,i m just loving the idea the more i m thinking about it  she has the poise  the voice and the class she s well rounded and perfect for the role please make this happen    <URL>  v  gscq_mn0evc
7995,startrek,i have no problem with this but consider the source unless i m very much mistaken this is speculation from a blackinterest website  take it with a pinch of salt for now 
7996,startrek,we could do a lot worse it feels like a political choice but she s a fine actress 
7997,startrek,my vote  jared harris from expanse  mad men  and sherlock holmes   <URL>
7998,startrek,mmm so long as it s not another attempt at  strong female captain  and is  well written  interesting characters  i ll be onboard with whomever they pick
7999,startrek,depends for me  if it means she will no longer be on american horror story then no thank you
