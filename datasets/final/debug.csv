0,harrypotter,that white line at the end must be the kings cross scene with dumbledore 
1,harrypotter,i have regrettably not kept up with all of the information that has been added to the hp world since the books were finished  in the next few years i would love to reread the whole series  but it would be really fun to have all of the new information interjected throughout with asides  footnotes  etc  thoughts 
2,harrypotter,yes  i saw a new version of the annotated alice in wonderland the other day  and it s amazing  it s like a huge illustrated version  similar in sizeshape to the illustrated harry potter and the sorcerer s stone   but the actual story is written on like 13 of each page  with extra information and paragraphs and illustrations in the empty parts designwise  it s beautiful  and it s such a cool way to read the book  but it would have to be very wellthought out as far as what information is revealed when  
3,harrypotter,it would break the flow of the story the only way to add it is by pulling a tolkien and putting all the pottermore stuff in a post dhending appendices they could also add some extensive family trees of the main characters 
4,harrypotter,this was my bulletin board for the month too  p   <URL>
5,harrypotter,you are the type of ra i hope i can be if i manage to get selected  my current ras are great guys  but they did a great gatsby theme instead of harry potter 
6,harrypotter,probably the best book to movie adaptation that s ever been released  at least imo 
7,harrypotter,awesome drawing 
8,harrypotter,wait til my father here s about this 
9,harrypotter,i feel there was nt enough in the movies actually it seems worse in the movies because all the pranks and fighting back against her  catharsis  fireworks  weasleys  is nt in the movie until just before they go to the ministry and the decrees were in higher number so i imagine in the film s universe it felt a lot worse whereas in the books it would ve been better 
10,starwars,he died for our spins 
11,starwars,i do nt think he necessarily knows that has any connection to luke though pretty sure he just interprets it as rey s own internalization of her isolation and loneliness in her dreams she probably does too  because i m assuming she was having those dreams before she even heard that luke and the jedi actually exist 
12,starwars,both times i saw it  it seemed to me that meant that she had been on the island with him before  as a child for that to be true would mean that luke was nt  hunting  for the island  but already knew where it was i m fine with that logic for now  since he may have wanted to keep it a secret wow  maybe he found her there 
13,starwars,the tie fighters flying over was a nice touch  well done 
14,starwars,they sure did    youtubeqds6re3hgo
15,starwars,this is awesome but it is missing the sick spins 
16,starwars,awesome  really well made
17,starwars,brains would nt have to be slow roasted they re quite tender as is i would suggest a slow braise for the legs  grind the arms and shoulder for stormtrooperloaf and just make soup out of the rest  my god  what did i just write 
18,starwars,the book aftermath pretty much confirmed it through one of the characters accounts of endor 
19,starwars,you ca nt look into the dead hatefilled eyes of those godless killing machines  and not see the soul of a monster yeah they ate those bodies  then made ornaments from their skulls 
20,leagueoflegends,just use pings do nt type to people  do nt use chat i ve never been a rager  but it seems you may just have some self control issues if you have a problem not saying anything  also  anything you say is probably not going to be followed and all you re doing is making the game worse for everyone you re playing with you are literally making the game harder to win by flaming people that make mistakes do yourself a favor and just let mistakes go  there is a 100  chance that you also make plenty of mistakes  everyone does  so them making a mistake is not that big of a deal 
21,leagueoflegends,hey guys  i m a flamer and i m one of those guys who make league shitty and  famous  for their bad community i tried so many things already to prevent insulting my teammates because they did something wrong  or even i did something wrong does any of you feel the same and know a solution how to get a non toxic player 
22,leagueoflegends,one thing that helped me was any one of the plethora of videos out there that point out how futile it is to flame people  it does nt make my teammates feel good  it does nt make me feel good because i still got the loss  and it does nt help me win there is literally no benefit to raging at people 
23,leagueoflegends,shout at the screen and do nt type you end up venting but your teammates do nt even know you re raging 
24,leagueoflegends,hire a elo booste and boost your accountonce you get to higher rank and play with people much better than you  you will know how garbage your are 
25,leagueoflegends,you cant  its who you are you tend to be get angry real easily just like me  yes you can control yourself a bit but in the end you have to flame or you ll lose your shit
26,leagueoflegends,if you put  first and you type what you say no one will see it sometimes it helps me release steam without hurting poor little malphites feelings
27,leagueoflegends,which artworks did you count  i feel like there are way more than these  for example  your list does nt have gangplank but he was in  this picture     <URL>  story1  together with graves  you also did nt count the following artworks made by riot    <URL>  no vi    <URL>  no lux  not sure if you have counted these two    <URL>   <URL>
28,leagueoflegends,xpeke for sure
29,leagueoflegends,ashe was the first champ i saw in ads on websites also bought a headset with a code for a free ashe skin and 2win ip boost did nt play yet  gave the code to a friend tt
30,pokemon,love the shading on the colored ones 
31,pokemon,reminds me of ash s goodra     why  
32,pokemon,the hair looks like moms from futurama love your work 
33,pokemon,ultragod
34,pokemon,apricorns to make pokeballs and walking with your pokemon 
35,pokemon,hold up ash is a squirrel ash s mom is a deer i m no biologist  but i do nt think that s how that works 
36,pokemon,lmfao sooooo cute
37,pokemon,i love this style  and great colours 
38,pokemon,it really is nt a feature i miss  but a gameplay aspect i m starting to notice  i miss how gym leaders could use a different number of pok  mon ever since black and white came out  the first two gym leaders use 2 pok  mon while the rest of them use 3 the other regions had some variety  in kanto for example  brock and misty use 2  lt surge uses 3 or 1 depending on the version  erika  sabrina  and blaine use 3  koga uses 4  and giovanni uses 5   elite four using 4 pok  mon is also something i do nt like i know oras is nt guilty of this but i think z will  i also miss the level variations the gym leaders  elite four  champion  and other bosses had i m sure many have noticed how the lead pok  mon is at the same level as every other pok  mon that the boss uses except for the ace  the lead pok  mon is always 2 levels less than the ace   it s just making the games a bit more predictable 
39,pokemon,both 2nd map  and the dressup feature from xy i know dressup is hilariously minor  and it wo nt make or break a game for me  but i always get a little excited about customizing my trainer and i love collecting things 
40,gameofthrones,i have a theory that there are too many theoretical theories going around  how s that for a theory 
41,gameofthrones,they ve all killed each other without acknowledging the  real  enemy amassing north of the wall that s why it s called a  game  of thrones 
42,gameofthrones,this is a reminder that theories still need to be tagged in this thread this post has an  all spoilers  title warning  but no  theory  warning spoilers from the books and show are fine without tags  but    major theory comments need green speculation spoiler tags       <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide   if you are unsure how to tag your comment  the  spoiler guide     <URL>  wiki_spoiler_tag_syntax_guide  has examples of the markup you can use   i am a bot  and this action was performed automatically please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   <URL>  to  rgameofthrones  if you have any questions or concerns 
43,gameofthrones,stark does nt matter they have plot armor they will win  tullytullys seem tight with the stark  sooo yeah arrynthey are screwed baratheon there s still gendry  edric storm and mya stone tyrell margaery is probably safe  but it is entirely possible that the tarlys decide to take over martellspretty safe lannistermany many lannisters left  are you forgetting greyjoys  gt  and well  house targaryen does not even has lands at this point maybe dany could get along with the martells and take dragonstone and the stormlands but for now they re not part of the seven kingdoms  there is no way the matrells could ger along with dany after quentyn aegon has the stormlands 
44,gameofthrones,i could and would argue that the seven great houses are still in tact meaning they could be a stronger bond than the realm itself living through this rebellion and that  including ww   not saying this is the end game  as i m sure some will actually see its  line end but just a thought  for the moment at least 
45,gameofthrones,daenerys does own lands  meereen  i think
46,gameofthrones,stannis could still be alive 
47,gameofthrones,there s also the lannisport lannisters if the main family falls  jamie cersei etc  then the lannisport lannisters will most likely take control of casterly rock starks obviously look fucked now but of course they re the protagonists of the show so they ll be back as for the tully s someone commented saying they ll be alright because they re tight with the starks but idk i could see george fucking them over  its thrones and the good guys do nt always win but the blackfish is a huge badass and could keep them going baratheons are so fucked unless some of the bastards get legitimized the arryns are pretty fucked too

49,gameofthrones,i must be the only person on reddit who has never had a problem with assembly on ikea products 
50,himym,the writers knew how to use music got ta give that to them 
51,himym,it  s pretty good  but maybe not even the best teaser in that episode when marshall says  i  m never drinking again   and then it flashes forward to the night he gets wasted in atlantic city which ends up being the season finale 
52,himym,the whole episode has the riff of victoria  by the kinks in  starting with ted showing off at the news stand  right the way through the barneynorah stuff  leading to the reveal of ted bumping into victoria at the end  i bloody love how they hint at stuff on this show  and this was one of the best examples 
53,himym,this is a really nice gif
54,himym,i totally get what you mean i see the barney grin 
55,himym,you  re not missing much  sometimes i think i  d rather have stopped after season <SMILE> and left it a mystery 
56,himym,me too thanks
57,himym,which episode is this from 
58,himym,i am simply creating a discussion thread for those who have binged the entire final season  i watched it live  thought it was ok  and then binged the season one lazy sunday i enjoyed it so much more after this way i encourage you all to give this a shot  particularly if you did nt like the finale 
59,himym,it s much better but also leads to incredible mood swings  especially from james 
60,mylittlepony,   fluttershh  pinkie  i know we are posing to look badass  but can you please move the chainsaw just a  little  bit further away from my head

72,startrek,would nt spock have found it a bit  insulting  to have been referred to as the  most human soul  kirk had encountered  i love the scene  but that quote always seemed slightly off to me  thoughts 
73,startrek,also  what is a soul
74,startrek,spock was half human and had worked for some time on understanding  feeling and showing his human emotions it was a heartfelt compliment and would have been taken so i m sure 
75,startrek,i got a notice from audible this afternoon that the new book from uwilliamshatner about leonard has been released i know what i will be listening to in the car this week    <URL>   <URL>
76,startrek,i kinda hope parts of the proceeds go to a charity  or else  in my unimportant opinion  its a kind of morally questionable thing to make money from 
77,startrek,star trek the next generation final episode 7937 days ago star trek the original series final episode 1<SMILE>056 days ago i thought putting in in days offers a new perspective 
78,startrek,so  i m in my first viewing of voyager  and i have to say that this is probably one of the funniest episodes i have seen so far  there are other pure comedy episodes but this one takes the cake the doctor is such a lovable character  looking for parmac  spelling   in all the wrong places  our man bashir  little green men  that episode with barclay in tng when he goes  james bondish   bride of chaotica  mmm those come to mind right now  i m certain there are others  but this one is just 45 minutes of grinning and laughing with a few  serious  moments to catch your breath  and i like it when star trek goes out of its way to make something lighthearted and fun amidst all the starfleet protocol  so anyway  season 6  and i have to say that voyager is way better than people make it out to be  it does have its problems  but if you are watching a series about a starship that can travel faster than the speed of light  a few extra shuttlecrafts or writers with hangover once in a while should not be your main focus  he caracters are great  just like every other series  even when they start very lame and unlikable  they grow on you a lot  even neelix  for example  piccard s1e1 was a dick  tucker s1e1 was generic texas boy  bashir uggghhh  even the sisko  you get the idea  anyway  i m getting close to complete the whole voyage  but looking forward to july and even more to 2017  llap 
79,startrek,it took me quite i while to get into but i ended up enjoying enterprise  not quite as much as the others but still some good memories that is  when i wasnt getting angry at the forced love plot  with trip and tpol or the blatent and obscene sexing up of her character unlike many i enjoyed the long arch of the expanse  anyhow enough on that for now what else can scratch the trek itch  i havent gotten through all of ds9 yet mainly because i found the religious stuff hard to palate but if i got through all of enterprise s trangressions i imagine ds9 will be tame in comparison  what else is there non trek  since ive watched them all now apart from the remainder of ds9  i am trying babylon 5 again since it has alot of rave reviews and high sci fi cred from all ive read i dont expect super special effects but the show is so low budget i find it jarring and hard to get into i saw an episode with some ant creature and it was star trek original series bad and the sets seem so cramped it gives the impression of being filmed in someones backyard garage i will keep trying with it though maybe things smooth out  i mean tng was filmed before that by quite a few years and nearly always looked classy  i have been trying battlestar galactica but after a few episodes that seems like quite a mockery of the genre and grotesquely overrated i feel everything in life has continued to go downhill after the millenium everything was gold in the <SMILE>0s and 90s  andromeda looks to be a sleeper hit i have on my rader  so what say ye all you star trek stalwarts  what will satisfy my yearning heart
