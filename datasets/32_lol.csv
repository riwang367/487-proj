0,leagueoflegends,renekton will always be a good option between graves or quinn though  i d say quinn gnar is also a great option 
1,leagueoflegends,poppy is decent 
2,leagueoflegends,get taric nobody expects taric top then you just rub your gems all over their face 
3,leagueoflegends,sion fuck 6300 shit
4,leagueoflegends,get dr boom it s the best   card   champion in the game right now and he works with any   deck   team comp plus   blizzard   riot will never nerf him 
5,leagueoflegends,no one suggested malphite  the hell 
6,leagueoflegends,i have literally no brain but i still want to win  malphite i have about 10  of a brain  poppy i have about 50  of a brain  fiora i am duo with adci only play support how do i cs   lulu i wanted mid  lissandra i am smurfingi want to make melee top suicidal  quinn i miss playing riven  irelia i want to be strong in lane but no mechanical skill  renekton i want to solo kill enemy lane and carry teamfight  wukong i want to solo kill enemy lane and 1v9 rest of game  olaf mute all  heimerdinger i want to win lane but lose game after 20  pantheon i want to lose lane and game  yasuo stop getting caught   tryndamere mid open   jin i love memes xdxdxd        i am a girl  teemo gank my lane or i go afk   riven if you gank my lane i go afk   nasus i m bronze 4   illaoi as you can see you have a lot of different choices  just choose whichever one you think sounds more like you 
7,leagueoflegends,i got 63k ip which champ do you guys suggest  was leaning to quinngraves 
8,leagueoflegends,great survey  best of luck on the project 
9,leagueoflegends,great survey  you should do an aftermath post 
10,leagueoflegends,hello people from reddit  i m a summoner from league of legend and i m asking for your help to do this survey  its a personalschool project  i would like to see is there positivenegative impact while playing league of legend   <URL> lt  here s the link if you are interested
11,leagueoflegends,i get really upset every time these casters pronounce  zzrot  as  zeezyrot 
12,leagueoflegends,just put wickd on the bench  he does nothing for the team and gets more resources than any other player in game cw denied all the resources possible to werlyb and let wickd on a sidelane pushing 1v1 against holyphoenix and he goes aggresive  dies 1v1 wasting both summoners and wasnt even half as usefull as werlyb was on malphite 
13,leagueoflegends,haha wickd gt  lt 
14,leagueoflegends,i could nt see it  how was sirnukesalot playing  i always hope for him to do well but cw seem to lose all of their games  
15,leagueoflegends,actually it was pretty sad to see cw trying to deny resources from werlyb to put wickd ahead and see how he still does shit  the 2nd game was just a very wp game by huma  i would love to see welyb  godbro and santorin in lcs but that will be hard  millenium is pretty good even if they lost today and inspire are so good too 
16,leagueoflegends,btw boys  dat godbro is the same guy as neegodbro the former top laner from cw 
17,leagueoflegends,sirnukes is a classic example of his trope
18,leagueoflegends,time to start banning gragas again 
19,leagueoflegends,godbro leblanc is nasty man 
20,leagueoflegends,santorin played really well this series
21,leagueoflegends,santorin on gragas feelstsmman
22,leagueoflegends,retire already wickd 
23,leagueoflegends,maybe thats just me but i find it super weird how much huma prioritizes gragas on santorin
24,leagueoflegends,werlyb is actually a pretty good player i always felt like he was underrated on giants i m glad he s doing alright in challenger series and i hope to see this team in lcs  probably wo nt be possible with inspire amp  millenium playing like they are right now tho
