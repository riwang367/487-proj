7,harrypotter,1  i totally forget how _ reacts after he sees the memories i think maybe he just sits down and cries for a bit  it was a lot to take in  2  _ kicks _ out of the dungeons after that lesson iirc  _ basically runs out of the dungeons and ends up on some stairs feeling nauseous about how he just saw his father behave  25  _ and _ had started to bully _ on the _ express before they had even gotten sorted yet both _ and _ came from money and gave _ crap for wanting to be in _ house  like his mother _ was   so  _ did not instigate the bullying by fifth year  _ was very much into the dark arts and was hanging around shady people and _ was about to stop being such an arse all the time from _ s point of view  _ stole her from _ s point of view  _ had become toxic and _ was a changed man calling her a _ was the last straw and she cut _ out of her life and _ and her clicked and they started dating  _ s memory did nt change what _ didwas _ grew up and matured  3  in order of the _   at _ _ during the christmas holidays i think   _ gives _ a package and tells him if he ever should need to be in contact  to use what s in the package _ has just seen a spat between _ and _ and does not want to be the reason _ ends up getting killed so  _ never opens the package  which contained the mirror shard he  does  open the package  after  _ has died and feels like an idiot for not having opened it sooner _ _ ends up stealing stuff from _ place after _ dies he ends up selling the other half of the mirror to _  _ s brother who owns the _ s _ tavern   so  when _ keeps seeing bright blue eyes in the mirror during _ _  it s actually _ keeping a watchful eye on _ in case he needs help  4  _ had just asked _ if he had grown to care about _ _ casts his _ it s a doe just like _ s _ was a doe _ realizes that _ is still fighting for _  _ after all this time   _ replies  always   in that _ had always loved _ in that he never stopped  or will stop  loving her 
8,harrypotter,all of these questions are answered by the books  and some answered might be a little spoilery for some aspects that the movies never went into if you d rather not have any further spoilers  please stop reading here  a this is complicated and is actually a long overarcing thread in the last book through out the book  _  at many points  feels very frustrated with _ and the amount of secrets he kept from _ however he also comes to see that mostly when _ was keeping secrets  it was as a benefit to _ it might not be something _ liked  but it was something he needed eventually  _ makes a decision to trust in _ s judgement and sort of comes to accept that he can not always know everything and that sometimes he needs to not act  which is enormously hard for him   when he sees those memories  he does think about _ s betrayal  but it feels to him as a minor thing against the knowledge that he has to die  gt  slowly  very slowly  he sat up  and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was  brain and nerve and bounding heart  it would all be gone    or at least  he would be gone from it his breath came slow and deep  and his mouth and throat were completely dry  but so were his eyes  gt  _  s betrayal was almost nothing of course there had been a bigger plan  _ had simply been too foolish to see it  he realized that now  the thing is that _ does see the sense of it he understands why _ did what he did  and he understands why he is the one who has to die  and if it is him  then nobody else has to at this point  _ s emotions are a huge mess he is in a great state of shock and wanting to live but knowing he can not  so anger is not at the forefront of his brain eventually when he meets _  after being killed  by _  the shock has worn off  but he is still mostly confused  which keeps him from feeling anger it also helps that pretty much one of the first things _ tells him is that he is not exactly dead then _ goes on to explain and apologises to _  with tears in his eyes  which helps _ understand that everything _ did  he did nt do for the funsies he made these decisions because they were the best ones  but they were nt easy or kind  not even on _ himself  which is what helps _ come to peace with them  honestly  the books go way more in depth with _ s feelings re  _ than anyone could ever do in a simple post  so i very much urge you to read them it will help clarify a lot  b when _ first finds out about the bully _ was in the past  it actually bothers him a lot there is quite a chunk of the fifth book that deals with _ thinking about what he saw in the pensive and his father s behaviour he does quite a dangerous thing  using _ s fire to talk to _ and _  just to get more information on his father s behaviour eventually he learns to give it a place he still loves his father  obviously  but he thinks of him with slightly less blind idealism still  from all accounts  it does seem like _  honestly  changed  and _ was nt exactly innocent in all of it either  _ and _ pretty much continuously hexed each other  so it is not like _ is an unrepenting douchebag either he s a person who made douchy choices as a teen  but also made a lot of good ones during that same time of his life  who eventually grew out of it  which is sort of how _ comes to remember him  c in the order of the _  after christmas  _ gives _ one of a pair of twoway mirrors but does nt explain them they are basically like mirror walkietalkies  that _ and _ used to use to talk to each other in detention _  realising it is a way to contact _  fears that doing so will make _ do something stupid and dangerous and puts them in the bottom of his trunk he forgets about them  even when he needs them most after _ s death  _ remembers the mirror  however because _ is dead  he can not use them anymore still  he does nt get rid of it it eventually shatters  but _ keeps the biggest piece the second mirror  the one that belonged to _ is found by _ when he is looting _ s house for stuff to sell he sells that mirror to _  _ s brother  who realises what is _ uses the mirror to keep an eye on _  it is his blue eye _ sees  and eventually uses it to send _ to them when they are in great danger  d _ loved _ _ has never loved anyone but _ _ cared great for him  as a friend  and potentially more according to _  but the path _ put himself on  the one with the dark arts  turned her away from him it all came to a head when _ called her a _ _ ended their friendship there  but _ did nt stop loving her because he loved her  he tried to ask _ to spare her  and through that  gave _ an out  which she refused to take but instead protected her son   knowing that _ loved _ so much  _ used that love to get _ on their side when _ asks if _ s feeling are still the same after all this time  _ casts that _  _ s _ had been a doe as well  and tell him  yes  always he s still in this for _ 
9,harrypotter,this is the problem with watching the movies first     read the books asap the movies are fun entertainment but you wo nt get nearly as much out of them as you will out of the books i hope you get to soon and you re enjoying your _ journey  i can try to answer some of your questions  in the books _ goes through some more emotions about _ having known he would need to die ultimately i think he comes out still admiring _ because he knew how hard it was for him and that this was the only choice also  he was going through so many emotions about his own life that being mad at someone else was nt at the top of his mind  i think the _ thing is very much up for debate i ve heard a lot of insightful things on this sub though  the mirror was from _ he gave it to him as a gift there are two that are connected  the idea being _ had one and _ had one and they would be able to talk through them   someone correct me if i m wrong but i think _ gets the other one after it was stolen from _ place by _  _ is represented by a doe this makes sense because she and _ were together and his _  and probably _  was a stag the _ is important because it is much stronger evidence that he still loves _ than just saying he does they talk about how only something really powerful emotionally can change a person s _  hope this helps other people help me out if i ve missed stuff i m sure i ve messed up a lot of spelling  sorry about that
