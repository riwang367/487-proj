    "**Topic:** Introduction to Python for NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to EECS 487, Introduction to Natural Language Processing! Today's lab assignment will provide a brief introduction to Python for NLP. Specifically, we will learn about several Python libraries that will prove useful for this course and for any NLP tasks you might want to pursue in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 0. Prerequisites\n",
    "This tutorial assumes that you have already installed Python >= 3.9 and iPython onto your machine. If you have not already, please install Python from [the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or from a package manager such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) (recommended). By default, Python only comes with [the Python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). Installing Python via Anaconda will automatically install many additional packages that will come in handy later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, if you have not done so already **please sign up for One Cool Thing** using this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qj1kCUy39eOTnCgi1PosUHbsBYOjewU8b9PTAlXu0VQ/edit#gid=0). You must do so by 11:59pm today, so we will pause for a couple minutes during lab to give you time to do it right now. **This is worth 5% of your final grade!**"

    "# 3. Regular Expressions\n",
    "A regular expression is a piece of code (written in the standardized regular expression language) that specifies a textual pattern. For instance, I could use natural language to refer to \"the set of all words beginning with the letter a,\" however (as EECS 487 discusses extensively) this is very difficult for a computer to parse. Regular expressions enable us to formally specify textual patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions enable programs to quickly search large bodies of text for particular patterns. They can enable tasks such as information extraction (finding and returning important pieces of information to the user/program), word replacement, and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting application of regular expressions is [ELIZA](https://web.njit.edu/~ronkowit/eliza.html), an early chatbot (created in 1966!) that imitated a Rogerian psychotherapist. Although relatively simple under the hood, ELIZA is a convincing dialogue partner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) comes preinstalled with `re`, a package for defining and using regular expressions. Here is [a link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) to the package documentation. Throughout this tutorial we will learn how to define regular expressions using `re`, and we will conclude with an exercise giving you the opportunity to apply your knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "While working with `re`, it may be helpful to use a [regex cheatsheet](https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1665049611/Marketing/Blog/Regular_Expressions_Cheat_Sheet.pdf). This cheatsheet provides an overview of the types of patterns you can specify using `re`."

      "On July 9, 1923, special agent Betty Crocker was deployed to the United States to conduct Operation Apple Pie, a highly classified investigation aimed at uncovering espionage activities connected to several American corporations suspected of leaking military intelligence. Upon her arrival, Betty rendezvoused with Agent Ronald McDonald on July 17, 1923 (17/07/1923) at a nondescript diner in Brooklyn, precisely at 09:45, to discuss tactical maneuvers. Subsequently, on the eve of September 1 (01/09/1923), they initiated the first phase by infiltrating the corporate office of Wendy's, only to uncover encrypted letters involving an individual code-named \"Colonel Sanders.\" During this period, Betty communicated covertly with the mission control team through her alias, MissPillsbury1923@securemail.com, while Ronald used the secure line ClownAgentUSA@ops.gov for encrypted messaging. As they delved deeper into the mission, an unscheduled meeting with agents Ben and Jerry was set for October 12, 1923, at 00:01 hours to assess progress and re-strategize. However, on November 11 (11/11), an urgent memo was received at 15:23, alerting them of a potential double agent operating under the pseudonym \"Uncle Ben.\" The mission concluded on the winter solstice of the same year, December 21, 1923, at precisely 18:00, during which they utilized the final encryption key to decrypt highly sensitive documents. The documents confirmed covert operations tied to the top echelons of Coca-Cola, with far-reaching international implications. A debriefing was held on December 24 at 07:00 hours, where Betty and Ronald were commended for their unparalleled service.
